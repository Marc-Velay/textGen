 UNK this tale grew in the telling until it became a history of the great war of the ring and included many glimpses of the yet more ancient history that UNK it it was begun soon after the hobbit was written and before its UNK in  but i did not go on with this UNK for i wished first to complete and set in order the UNK and legends of the elder days which had then been taking shape for some years i desired to do this for my own UNK and i had little hope that other people would be interested in this work especially since it was UNK UNK in UNK and was begun in order to UNK the necessary UNK of history for elvish tongues unk when those whose advice and UNK i sought UNK little hope to no hope i went back to the UNK encouraged by UNK from readers for more information concerning hobbits and their adventures but the story was drawn UNK towards the older world and became an account as it were of its end and passing away before its beginning and middle had been told the process had begun in the writing of the hobbit in which there were already some UNK to the older matter elrond gondolin the UNK and the ores as well as glimpses that had arisen UNK of things higher or deeper or darker than its surface durin moria gandalf the UNK the ring the discovery of the UNK of these glimpses and of their UNK to the ancient histories revealed the third age and its UNK in the war of the ring those who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got it but they had to wait a long time for the UNK of the lord of the rings went on at UNK during the years  to  a UNK in which i had many UNK that i did not UNK and many other UNK as a UNK and UNK that often UNK me the delay was of course also increased by the UNK of war in  by the end of which year the tale had not yet reached the end of book one in spite of the darkness of the next five years i found that the story could not now be wholly UNK and i plodded on mostly by night till i stood by balins tomb in moria there i halted for a long while it was almost a year later when i went on and so came to lothlurien and the great river late in  in the next year unk i wrote the first UNK of the matter that now stands as book three and the beginnings of chapters i and UNK of book five and there as the UNK flared in UNK and UNK came to UNK i stopped UNK had failed and there was no time for thought it was during  that leaving the loose ends and UNK of a war which it was my task to UNK or at least to report  forced myself to UNK the journey of frodo to mordor these chapters eventually to become book four were written and sent out as a UNK to my son UNK then in south UNK with the UNK nonetheless it took another five years before the tale was brought to its present end in that time i changed my house my chair and my UNK and the days though less dark were no less UNK then when the end had at last been reached the whole story had to be UNK and indeed largely UNK backwards and it had to be UNK and UNK by me the UNK of UNK UNK by the UNK was beyond my means the lord of the rings has been read by many people since it finally appeared in UNK and i should like to say something here with UNK to the many UNK or guesses that i have received or have read concerning the UNK and meaning of the tale the UNK UNK was the desire of a UNK to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the attention of readers UNK them delight them and at times maybe UNK them or deeply move them as a guide i had only my own UNK for what is UNK or moving and for many the guide was UNK often at fault some who have read the book or at any rate have UNK it have found it UNK absurd or UNK and i have no cause to UNK since i have similar UNK of their works or of the kinds of writing that they evidently UNK but even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed my story there is much that fails to please it is perhaps not possible in a long tale to please UNK at all points nor to UNK UNK at the same points for i find from the letters that i have received that the passages or chapters that are to some a UNK are all by others specially approved the most UNK UNK of all myself now finds many UNK UNK and UNK but being UNK under no UNK either to UNK the book or to write it again he will pass over these in silence except one that has been UNK by others the book is too short as for any inner meaning or message it has in the UNK of the author none it is neither UNK nor UNK as the story grew it put down roots into the past and threw out unexpected branches but its main UNK was settled from the UNK by the UNK choice of the ring as the UNK between it and the hobbit the UNK chapter the shadow of the past is one of the oldest parts of the tale it was written long before the UNK of  had yet become a threat of UNK disaster and from that point the story unk would have UNK along UNK the same lines if that disaster had been UNK its UNK are things long before in mind or in some UNK already written and little or nothing in it was UNK by the war that began in  or its UNK the real war does not UNK the UNK war in its process or its UNK if it had UNK or UNK the UNK of the legend then certainly the ring would have been seized and used against sauron he would not have been UNK but UNK and UNK would not have been destroyed but occupied saruman failing to get UNK of the ring would m the UNK and UNK of the time have found in mordor the missing UNK in his own UNK into UNK and before long he would have made a great ring of his own with which to challenge the UNK UNK of middle-earth in that UNK both sides would have held hobbits in hatred and UNK they would not long have survived even as UNK other UNK could be UNK according to the UNK or UNK of those who like UNK or UNK UNK but i UNK dislike UNK in all its UNK and always have done so since i grew old and wary enough to UNK its presence i much UNK history true or UNK with its UNK UNK to the thought and experience of readers i think that many UNK UNK with UNK but the one UNK in the UNK of the UNK and the other in the UNK UNK of the author an author cannot of course remain wholly UNK by his experience but the ways in which a UNK uses the UNK of experience are UNK UNK and UNK to UNK the process are at best guesses from evidence that is UNK and UNK it is also false though UNK UNK when the lives of an author and UNK have UNK to suppose that the movements of thought or the events of times common to both were UNK the most powerful UNK one has indeed UNK to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its UNK but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by  was no less hideous an experience than to be UNK in  and the following years by  all but one of my close friends were dead or to take a less grievous matter it has been supposed by some that the UNK of the shire UNK the UNK in UNK at the time when i was UNK my tale it does not it is an UNK part of the plot foreseen from the UNK though in the event UNK by the character of saruman as UNK in the story without need i say any UNK UNK or UNK UNK UNK UNK it has indeed some UNK in experience though slender for the UNK UNK was entirely different and much further back the country in which i lived in UNK was being UNK destroyed before i was ten in days when UNK were rare UNK i had never seen one and men were still building UNK UNK UNK i saw in a UNK a UNK of the last UNK of the once UNK UNK beside its pool that long ago seemed to me so important i never liked the looks of the young miller but his father the old miller had a black beard and he was not named UNK man the lord of the rings is now issued in a new UNK and the UNK has been taken of UNK it a number of UNK and UNK that still remained in the UNK have been UNK and an attempt has been made to UNK information on a few points which UNK readers have raised i have considered all their UNK and UNK and if some seem to have been passed over that may be because i have failed to keep my notes in order but many UNK could only be answered by UNK UNK or indeed by the UNK of an UNK UNK UNK much of the UNK that i did not UNK in the original UNK in UNK more UNK UNK information in the meantime this UNK UNK this UNK an UNK to the UNK some notes and an UNK of the names of UNK and places this UNK is in UNK complete in UNK but not in UNK since for the present purpose it has been necessary to UNK its UNK a complete UNK making full use of the UNK prepared for me by mrs UNK UNK belongs rather to the UNK UNK  UNK   concerning hobbits this book is largely concerned with hobbits and from its pages a UNK may discover much of their character and a little of their history further information will also be found in the selection from the red book of westmarch that has already been UNK under the title of the hobbit that story was UNK from the UNK chapters of the red book UNK by bilbo himself the first unk hobbit to become UNK in the world at large and called by him there and back again since they told of his journey into the east and his return an adventure which later UNK all the hobbits in the great events of that age that are here related many however may wish to know more about this remarkable people from the UNK while some may not possess the UNK book for such readers a few notes on the more important points are here collected from UNK and the first adventure is briefly recalled hobbits are an UNK but very ancient people more numerous UNK than they are today for they love peace and quiet and good UNK earth a well-ordered and UNK UNK was their favourite UNK they do not and did not understand or like UNK more UNK than a UNK UNK a UNK or a UNK though they were skilful with UNK even in ancient days they were as a rule UNK of the big folk as they call us and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find they are quick of hearing and UNK and though they are UNK to be fat and do not hurry UNK they are nonetheless UNK and UNK in their movements they possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and silently when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come UNK by and this an they have UNK until to men it may seem UNK but hobbits have never in fact studied magic of any kind and their UNK is due UNK to a UNK skill that UNK and UNK and a close friendship with the earth have UNK UNK by UNK and UNK UNK for they are a little people smaller than dwarves less UNK and UNK that is even when they are not actually much shorter their height is UNK UNK between two and four feet of our measure they seldom now reach three feet but they UNK dwindled they say and in ancient days they were taller according to the red book UNK took UNK son of UNK the second was four foot five and able to ride a horse he was UNK in all hobbit records only by two UNK UNK of old but that curious matter is UNK with in this book as for the hobbits of the shire with whom these tales are concerned in the days of their peace and UNK they were a merry folk they dressed in bright colours being UNK fond of yellow and green but they seldom wore shoes since their feet had tough UNK UNK and were clad in a thick curling hair much like the hair of their heads which was UNK brown thus the only craft little UNK among them was UNK but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other useful and UNK things their faces were as a rule UNK rather than beautiful broad UNK UNK with mouths UNK to laughter and to eating and drinking and laugh they did and eat and drink often and UNK being fond of simple UNK at all times and of six UNK a day when they could get them they were UNK and delighted in UNK and in presents which they gave away freely and eagerly accepted it is plain indeed that in spite of later UNK hobbits are relatives of ours far nearer to us than elves or even than dwarves of old they spoke the languages of men after their own fashion and liked and UNK much the same things as men did but what exactly our UNK is can no longer be discovered the beginning of hobbits lies far back in the elder days that are now lost and forgotten only the elves still UNK any records of that vanished time and their UNK are concerned almost entirely with their own history in which men appear seldom and hobbits are not mentioned at all yet it is clear that hobbits had in fact lived quietly in middle-earth for many long years before other folk became even aware of them and the world being after all full of strange creatures beyond count these little people seemed of very little importance but in the days of bilbo and of frodo his heir they suddenly became by no wish of their own both important and UNK and troubled the counsels of the wise and the great those days the third age of middle UNK are now long past and the shape of all lands has been changed but the regions in which hobbits then lived were doubtless the same as those in which they still UNK the UNK of the old world east of the sea of their original home the hobbits in bilbos time preserved no knowledge a love of UNK other than UNK lore was far from general among them but there remained still a few in the older families who studied their own books and even gathered reports of old times and distant lands from elves dwarves and men their own records began only after the UNK of the shire and their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than their wandering days it is clear nonetheless from these legends and from the evidence of their peculiar words and UNK that like many other folk hobbits had in the distant past moved westward their UNK tales seem to glimpse a time when they dwelt in the upper UNK of anduin between the eaves of UNK the great and the misty mountains why they later UNK the hard and perilous crossing of the mountains into eriador is no longer certain their own accounts speak of the UNK of men in the land and of a shadow that fell on the forest so that it became darkened and its new name was mirkwood before the crossing of the mountains the hobbits had already become divided into three somewhat different UNK harfoots stoors and UNK the harfoots were UNK of skin smaller and shorter and they were UNK and UNK their hands and feet were UNK and UNK and they preferred UNK and UNK the stoors were broader heavier in build their feet and hands were larger and they preferred flat lands and UNK the UNK were fairer of skin and also of hair and they were taller and UNK than the others they were UNK of trees and of woodlands the harfoots had much to do with dwarves in ancient times and long lived in the foothills of the mountains they moved westward early and UNK over eriador as far as weathertop while the others were still in the wilderland they were the most UNK and UNK UNK of hobbit and far the most numerous they were the most UNK to settle in one place and UNK preserved their UNK habit of living in tunnels and holes the stoors lingered long by the banks of the great river anduin and were less UNK of men they came west after the harfoots and followed the course of the loudwater southwards and there many of them long dwelt between UNK and the borders of UNK before they moved north again the UNK the least numerous were a UNK branch they were more friendly with elves than the other hobbits were and had more skill in language and song than in UNK and of old they preferred hunting to UNK they crossed the mountains north of rivendell and came down the river hoarwell in eriador they soon mingled with the other kinds that had UNK them but being somewhat UNK and more UNK they were often found as UNK or chieftains among UNK of harfoots or stoors even in bilbos time the strong UNK UNK could still be UNK among the greater families such as the tooks and the masters of buckland in the UNK of eriador between the misty mountains and the mountains of UNK the hobbits found both men and elves indeed a remnant still dwelt there of the dnedain the kings of men that came over the sea out of westernesse but they were UNK fast and the lands of their north kingdom were falling far and wide into waste there was room and to spare for UNK and ere long the hobbits began to settle in ordered UNK most of their UNK UNK had long disappeared and been forgotten in bilbos time but one of the first to become important still endured though UNK in size this was at bree and in the chetwood that lay round about some forty miles east of the shire it was in these early days doubtless that the hobbits learned their letters and began to write after the manner of the dnedain who had in their turn long before learned the art from the elves and in those days also they forgot whatever languages they had used before and spoke ever after the common speech the UNK as it was named that was current through all the lands of the kings from arnor to gondor and about all the UNK of the sea from UNK elf alas to UNK yet they kept a few words of their own as well as their own names of months and days and a great store of UNK names out of the past about this time legend among the hobbits first becomes history with a reckoning of years for it was in the one thousand six hundred and first year of the third age that the UNK UNK UNK and UNK set out from bree and having obtained UNK from the high king at UNK they crossed the brown river UNK with a great following of hobbits they passed over the bridge of UNK that had been built in the days of the power of the north kingdom and they took UNK the land beyond to dwell in between the river and the far downs all that was demanded of them was that they should keep the great bridge in UNK and all other bridges and roads speed the kings messengers and UNK his UNK thus began the UNK for the year of the crossing of the brandywine as the hobbits turned the name became year one of the shire and all later UNK were reckoned from it  at once the western hobbits fell in love with their new land and they remained there and soon passed once more out of the history of men and of elves while there was still a king they were in name his UNK but they were in fact UNK by their own chieftains and UNK not at all with events in the world outside to the last battle at UNK with the UNK of angmar they sent some UNK to the aid of the king or so they maintained though no tales of men record it but in that war the north kingdom ended and then the hobbits took the land for their own and they chose from their own UNK a thain to hold the authority of the king that was gone there for a thousand years they were little troubled by wars and they UNK and UNK after the dark plague sr  until the disaster of the long winter and the UNK that followed it many UNK then perished but the days of UNK - were at the time of this tale long past and the hobbits had again become accustomed to plenty the land was rich and kindly and though it had long been deserted when they entered it it had before been well UNK and there the king had once had many UNK UNK UNK and woods forty leagues it stretched from the far downs to the brandywine bridge and fifty from the northern moors to the marshes in the south the hobbits named it the shire as the region of the authority of their thain and a district of well-ordered business and there in that pleasant comer of the world they UNK their well-ordered business of living and they heeded less and less the world outside where dark things moved until they came to think that peace and plenty were the rule in middle-earth and the right of all UNK folk they forgot or UNK what little they had ever known of the UNK and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of the shire they were in fact sheltered but they had ceased to remember it at no time had hobbits of any kind been UNK and they had never fought among themselves in UNK days they had of course been often obliged to fight to UNK themselves in a hard world but in bilbos time that was very ancient history the last battle before this story opens and indeed the only one that had ever been fought within the borders of the shire was beyond living memory the battle of UNK sr  in which UNK took UNK an UNK of ores even the UNK had grown UNK and the wolves that had once come UNK out of the north in bitter white UNK were now only a UNK tale so though there was still some store of weapons in the shire these were used mostly as UNK hanging above UNK or on walls or gathered into the UNK at michel delving the UNK it was called for anything that hobbits had no UNK use for but were UNK to throw away they called a UNK their dwellings were UNK to become rather crowded with UNK and many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of that son nonetheless ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough they were if it came to it difficult to UNK or to kill and they were perhaps so UNK fond of good things not least because they could when put to it do without them and could UNK rough UNK by grief UNK or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well and looked no further than their UNK and their UNK faces though slow to UNK and for UNK UNK nothing that lived they were UNK at bay and at need could still handle arms they shot well with the bow for they were UNK and sure at the mark not only with bows and arrows if any hobbit stooped for a stone it was well to get quickly under cover as all trespassing beasts knew very well all hobbits had UNK lived in holes in the ground or so they believed and in such dwellings they still felt most at home but in the course of time they had been obliged to UNK other forms of UNK actually in the shire in bilbos days it was as a rule only the UNK and the UNK hobbits that maintained the old custom the UNK went on living in UNK of the most UNK kind mere holes indeed with only one window or none while the UNK still UNK more UNK UNK of the simple UNK of old but UNK UNK for these large and UNK tunnels or UNK as they called them were not everywhere to be found and in the flats and the UNK UNK the hobbits as they UNK began to build above ground indeed even in the UNK regions and the older villages such as hobbiton or UNK or in the chief UNK of the shire michel delving on the white downs there were now many houses of wood brick or stone these were specially UNK by UNK smiths UNK and UNK and others of that sort for even when they had holes to live in hobbits had long been accustomed to build UNK and UNK the habit of building UNK and UNK was said to have begun among the inhabitants of the marish down by the brandywine the hobbits of that UNK the eastfarthing were rather large and UNK and they wore UNK in muddy weather but they were well known to be stoors in a large part of their blood as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on their UNK no UNK or UNK had any trace of a beard indeed the folk of the marish and of buckland east of the river which they afterwards occupied came for the most part later into the shire up from UNK and they still had many peculiar names and strange words not found elsewhere in the shire it is UNK that the craft of building as many other UNK beside was UNK from the dnedain but the hobbits may have learned it direct from the elves the UNK of men in their youth for the elves of the high kindred had not yet forsaken middle-earth and they dwelt still at that time at the grey havens away to the west and in other places within reach of the shire three UNK of UNK age were still to be seen on the tower hills beyond the western marches they shone far off in the moonlight the UNK was UNK away standing alone upon a green mound the hobbits of the UNK said that one could see the sea from the UNK of that tower but no hobbit had ever been known to climb it indeed few hobbits had ever seen or UNK upon the sea and UNK still had ever returned to report it most hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats with deep UNK and not many of them could swim and as the days of the shire lengthened they spoke less and less with the elves and grew afraid of them and UNK of those that had dealings with them and the sea became a word of fear among them and a token of death and they turned their faces away from the hills in the west the craft of building may have come from elves or men but the hobbits used it in their own fashion they did not go in for towers their houses were usually long low and comfortable the oldest kind were indeed no more than built UNK of smials UNK with dry grass or UNK or UNK with UNK and having walls somewhat UNK that stage however belonged to the early days of the shire and hobbit UNK had long since been UNK UNK by UNK learned from dwarves or discovered by themselves a UNK for round windows and even round doors was the chief remaining UNK of UNK the houses and the holes of shire-hobbits were often large and inhabited by large families bilbo and frodo baggins were as UNK very UNK as they were also in many other ways such as their friendship with the elves sometimes as in the case of the tooks of great smials or the brandybucks of brandy hall many generations of relatives lived in UNK peace together in one UNK and many UNK UNK all hobbits were in any case UNK and reckoned up their UNK with great care they drew long and UNK family -trees with UNK branches in UNK with hobbits it is important to remember who is related to whom and in what UNK it would be impossible in this book to set out a family UNK that included even the more important members of the more important families at the time which these tales tell of the UNK trees at the end of the red book of westmarch are a small book in themselves and all but hobbits would find them exceedingly dull hobbits delighted in such things if they were UNK they liked to have books filled with things that they already knew set out fair and square with no UNK  concerning pipe-weed there is another astonishing thing about hobbits of old that must be mentioned an astonishing habit they UNK or UNK through UNK of UNK or wood the smoke of the burning leaves of a UNK which they called pipe-weed or leaf a UNK probably of UNK a great deal of UNK UNK the origin of this peculiar custom or art as the hobbits preferred to call it all that could be discovered about it in UNK was put together by meriadoc brandybuck later master of buckland and since he and the UNK of the southfarthing play a part in the history that UNK his UNK in the UNK to his UNK of the shire may be UNK this he says is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our own UNK when hobbits first began to smoke is not known all the legends and family histories take it for UNK for ages folk in the shire UNK various herbs some UNK some UNK but all accounts agree that UNK UNK of UNK in the southfarthing first grew the true pipe-weed in his gardens in the days of UNK the second about the year  of UNK the best UNK still comes from that district especially the UNK now known as UNK leaf old UNK and southern star how old UNK came by the plant is not UNK for to his dying day he would not tell he knew much about herbs but he was no traveller it is said that in his youth he went often to bree though he certainly never went further from the shire than that it is thus quite possible that he learned of this plant in bree where now at any rate it grows well on the south slopes of the hill the UNK claim to have been the first UNK UNK of the pipe-weed they claim of course to have done everything before the people of the shire whom they UNK to as UNK but in this case their claim is i think likely to be true and certainly it was from bree that the art of smoking the UNK UNK spread in the recent UNK among dwarves and such other folk rangers wizards or wanderers as still passed to and fro through that ancient UNK the home and centre of the an is thus to be found in the old inn of bree the prancing pony that has been kept by the family of butterbur from time beyond record all the same UNK that i have made on my own many journeys south have UNK me that the UNK itself is not UNK to our parts of the world but came northward from the lower anduin whither it was i suspect UNK brought over sea by the men of westernesse it grows UNK in gondor and there is UNK and larger than in the north where it is never found wild and UNK only in warm sheltered places like UNK the men of gondor call it sweet UNK and UNK it only for the fragrance of its flowers from that land it must have been carried up the greenway during the long UNK between the coming of elendil and our own day but even the dnedain of gondor allow us this UNK hobbits first put it into UNK not even the wizards first thought of that before we did though one wizard that i knew took up the art long ago and became as skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind to  of the UNK of the shire the shire was divided into four UNK the farthings already UNK to north south east and west and these again each into a number of UNK which still bore the names of some of the old leading families although by the time of this history these names were no longer found only in their proper UNK nearly all tooks still lived in the UNK but that was not true of many other families such as the bagginses or the boffins outside the farthings were the east and west marches the buckland see beginning of chapter v book i and the westmarch added to the shire in sr  the shire at this time had hardly any UNK families for the most part managed their own affairs growing food and eating it occupied most of their time in other matters they were as a rule generous and not UNK but UNK and UNK so that UNK UNK UNK and small UNK tended to remain UNK for generations there remained of course the ancient UNK concerning the high king at UNK or UNK as they called it away north of the shire but there had been no king for nearly a thousand years and even the ruins of kings UNK were covered with grass yet the hobbits still said of wild folk and wicked things such as trolls that they had not heard of the king for they UNK to the king of old all their UNK UNK and usually they kept the UNK of free will because they were the rules as they said both ancient and just it is true that the took family had long been UNK for the UNK of thain had passed to them from the UNK some UNK before and the chief took had borne that title ever since the thain was the master of the UNK and captain of the UNK and the UNK but as UNK and UNK were only held in times of UNK which no longer occurred the UNK had ceased to be more than a UNK UNK the took family was still indeed UNK a special UNK for it remained both numerous and exceedingly UNK and was UNK to UNK in every UNK strong UNK of peculiar UNK and even UNK UNK the latter UNK however were now rather UNK in the rich than generally approved the custom endured nonetheless of UNK to the head of the family as the took and of UNK to his name if required a number such as UNK the second for instance the only real UNK in the shire at this UNK was the mayor of michel delving or of the shire who was UNK every seven years at the free fair on the white downs at the UNK that is at UNK as mayor almost his only UNK was to UNK at UNK given on the UNK which occurred at UNK UNK but the UNK of UNK and first UNK were UNK to the UNK so that he managed both the messenger service and the watch these were the only UNK and the messengers were the most numerous and much the UNK of the two by no means all hobbits were UNK but those who were wrote constantly to all their friends and a selection of their relations who lived further off than an UNK walk the UNK was the name that the hobbits gave to their UNK or the nearest UNK that they possessed they had of course no UNK such things being quite unknown only a feather in their UNK and they were in UNK rather UNK than UNK more concerned with the UNK of beasts than of people there were in all the shire only twelve of them three in each UNK for inside work a rather larger body UNK at need was UNK to beat the bounds and to see that outsiders of any kind great or small did not make themselves a nuisance at the time when this story begins the UNK as they were called had been greatly increased there were many reports and UNK of strange UNK and creatures UNK about the borders or over them the first sign that all was not quite as it should be and always had been except in tales and legends of long ago few heeded the sign and not even bilbo yet had any notion of what it UNK sixty years had passed since he set out on his UNK journey and he was old even for hobbits who reached a hundred as often as not but much evidently still remained of the UNK wealth that he had brought back how much or how little he revealed to no one not even to frodo his favourite nephew and he still kept secret the ring that he bad found  of the finding of the ring as is told in the hobbit  there came one day to bilbos door the great wizard gandalf the grey and UNK dwarves with him none other indeed than thorin UNK UNK of kings and his twelve companions in exile with them he set out to his own lasting astonishment on a morning of UNK it being then the year  UNK on a quest of great treasure the UNK of the kings under the mountain beneath UNK in dale far off in the east the quest was UNK and the dragon that guarded the UNK was destroyed yet though before all was won the battle of five armies was fought and thorin was slain and many deeds of UNK were done the matter would UNK have concerned later history or UNK more than a note in the long UNK of the third age but for an accident by the way the party was assailed by ores in a high pass of the misty mountains as they went towards wilderland and so it happened that bilbo was lost for a while in the black UNK deep under the mountains and there as he groped in vain in the dark he put his hand on a ring lying on the floor of a tunnel ele put it in his pocket it seemed then like mere luck trying to find his way out bilbo went on down to the roots of the mountains until he could go no further at the bottom of the tunnel lay a cold lake far from the light and on an island of rock in the water lived gollum he was a UNK little creature he paddled a small boat with his large flat feet peering with pale UNK eyes and catching blind fish with his long fingers and eating them UNK he ate any living thing even ore if he could catch it and UNK it without a struggle he possessed a secret treasure that had come to him long ages ago when he still lived in the light a ring of gold that made its UNK invisible it was the one thing he loved his precious and he talked to it even when it was not with him for he kept it hidden safe in a hole on his island except when he was hunting or UNK on the ores of the mines maybe he would have attacked bilbo at once if the ring had been on him when they met but it was not and the hobbit held in his hand an elvish knife which served him as a sword so to UNK time gollum UNK bilbo to the UNK saying that if he asked a riddle which bilbo could not guess then he would kill him and eat him but if bilbo defeated him then he would do as bilbo wished he would lead him to a way out of the tunnels since he was lost in the dark without hope and could neither go on nor back bilbo accepted the challenge and they asked one another many riddles in the end bilbo won the game more by luck as it seemed than by wits for he was UNK at last for a riddle to ask and cried out as his hand came upon the ring he lad picked up and forgotten what UNK i got in my pocket this gollum failed to answer though he demanded three guesses the UNK it is true UNK whether this last question was a mere question and not a riddle according to the UNK rules of the game but all agree that after UNK it and trying to guess the answer gollum was bound by his promise and bilbo pressed him to keep his word for the thought came to him that this slimy creature might prove false even though such UNK were held UNK and of old all but the UNK things feared to break them but after ages alone in the dark gollums heart was black and UNK was in it he slipped away and returned to the island of which bilbo knew nothing not far off in the dark water there he thought lay his ring he was hungry now and angry and once his precious was with him he would not fear any weapon at all but the ring was not on the island he had lost it it was gone his UNK sent a UNK down bilbos back though he did not yet understand what had happened but gollum had at last leaped to a guess too late what has it got in its UNK he cried the light in his eyes was like a green flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and UNK his precious just in time bilbo saw his peril and he fled blindly up the passage away from the water and once more he was saved by his luck for just as he ran he put his hand in his pocket and the ring slipped quietly on to his finger so it was that gollum passed him without seeing him and went to guard the way out lest the thief should escape warily bilbo followed him as he went along cursing and talking to himself about his precious from which talk at last even bilbo guessed the truth and hope came to him in the darkness he himself had found the marvellous ring and a chance of escape from the ores and from gollum at length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the lower gates of the mines on the eastward side of the mountains there gollum crouched at bay smelling and listening and bilbo was UNK to UNK him with his sword but pity stayed him and though he kept the ring in which his only hope lay he would not use it to help him kill the wretched creature at a UNK in the end gathering his courage he leaped over gollum in the dark and fled away down the passage pursued by his UNK cries of hate and despair thief thief baggins we UNK it for ever now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as bilbo first told it to his companions to them his account was that gollum had promised to give him a present if he won the game but when gollum went to fetch it from his island he found the treasure was gone a magic ring which had been given to him long ago on his birthday bilbo guessed that this was the very ring that he had found and as he had won the game it was already his by right but being in a tight place he said nothing about it and made gollum show him the way out as a reward instead of a present this account bilbo set down in his UNK and he seems never to have UNK it himself not even after the council of elrond evidently it still appeared in the original red book as it did in several of the copies and UNK but many copies UNK the true account as an UNK UNK no doubt from notes by frodo or UNK both of whom learned the truth though they seem to have been UNK to UNK anything actually written by the old hobbit himself gandalf however UNK bilbos first story as soon as he heard it and he continued to be very curious about the ring eventually he got the true tale out of bilbo after much UNK which for a while UNK their friendship but the wizard seemed to think the truth important though he did not say so to bilbo he also thought it important and UNK to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the first quite UNK to his habit the idea of a present was not mere UNK UNK all the same it was suggested to bilbo as he UNK by gollums talk that he UNK for gollum did in fact call the ring his birthday present many times that also gandalf thought strange and suspicious but he did not discover the truth in this point for many more years as will be seen in this book of bilbos later adventures little more need be said here with the help of the ring he escaped from the UNK at the gate and UNK his companions he used the ring many times on his quest chiefly for the help of his friends but he kept it secret from them as long as he could after his return to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone save gandalf and frodo and no one else in the shire knew of its UNK or so he believed only to frodo did he show the account of his journey that he was writing his sword sting bilbo hung over his UNK and his coat of marvellous mail the gift of the dwarves from the dragon UNK he UNK to a UNK to the michel delving UNK in fact but he kept in a UNK at bag end the old cloak and hood that he had worn on his UNK and the ring UNK by a fine chain remained in his pocket he returned to his home at bag end on june the UNK in his UNK year sr  and nothing very UNK occurred in the shire until mr baggins began the preparations for the UNK of his UNK birthday sr  at this point this history begins note on the shire records at the end of the third age the part played by the hobbits in the great events that led to the UNK of the shire in the UNK kingdom awakened among them a more UNK interest in their own history and many of their UNK up to that time still mainly UNK were collected and written down the greater families were also concerned with events in the kingdom at large and many of their members studied its ancient histories and legends by the end of the first UNK of the UNK age there were already to be found in the shire several UNK that contained many UNK books and records the UNK of these UNK were probably at UNK at great smials and at brandy hall this account of the end of the third age is drawn mainly from the red book of westmarch that most important source for the history of the war of the ring was so called because it was long preserved at UNK the home of the UNK UNK of the westmarch  it was in origin bilbos private UNK which he took with him to rivendell frodo brought it back to the shire together with many loose leaves of notes and during sr - he nearly filled its pages with his account of the war but UNK to it and preserved with it probably m a single red case were the three large UNK bound in red leather that bilbo gave to him as a parting gift to these four UNK there was added in westmarch a fifth UNK UNK UNK and various other matter concerning the hobbit members of the fellowship the original red book has not been preserved but many copies were made especially of the first UNK for the use of the UNK of the children of master UNK the most important copy however has a different history it was kept at great smials but it was written in UNK probably at the UNK of the UNK of peregrin and UNK in sr  UNK  its southern UNK UNK this note UNK kings UNK finished this work in UNK  it is an UNK copy in all UNK of the UNK book m minas tirith that book was a copy made at the UNK of king UNK of the red book of the UNK and was brought to him by the thain peregrin when he UNK to gondor in UNK  the UNK book was thus the first copy made of the red book and contained much that was later UNK or lost in minas tirith it received much UNK and many UNK especially of names words and UNK in the elvish languages and there was added to it an UNK UNK of those parts of the tale of aragorn and arwen which lie outside the account of the war the full tale is UNK to have been written by UNK UNK of the UNK UNK some time after the passing of the king but the chief importance of UNK copy is that it alone UNK the whole of bilbos UNK from the elvish these three UNK were found to be a work of great skill and UNK in which between  and  he had used all the UNK UNK to him in rivendell both living and written but since they were little used by frodo being almost entirely concerned with the elder days no more is said of them here since meriadoc and peregrin became the heads of their great families and at the same time kept up their UNK with rohan and gondor the UNK at bucklebury and UNK contained much that did not appear in the red book in brandy hall there were many works UNK with eriador and the history of rohan some of these were UNK or begun by meriadoc himself though in the shire he was chiefly remembered for his UNK of the shire and for his reckoning of years m which he discussed the UNK of the UNK of the shire and bree to those of rivendell gondor and rohan he also wrote a short UNK on old words and names in the shire having special interest in UNK the UNK with the language of the UNK of such UNK as UNK and old UNK in place names at great smials the books were of less interest to shire-folk though more important for larger history none of them was written by peregrin but he and his UNK collected many UNK written by UNK of gondor mainly copies or UNK of histories or legends UNK to elendil and his heirs only here in the shire were to be found UNK UNK for the history of nmenor and the UNK of sauron it was probably at great smials that the tale of years  was put together with the UNK of UNK collected by meriadoc though the UNK given are often UNK especially for the second age they deserve attention it is UNK that meriadoc obtained UNK and information from rivendell which he visited more than once there though elrond had departed his sons long remained together with some of the UNK folk it is said that celeborn went to dwell there after the departure of galadriel but there is no record of the day when at last he sought the grey havens and with him went the last living memory of the elder days in middle-earth  book i  chapter   a UNK party when mr bilbo baggins of bag end UNK that he would UNK be UNK his UNK UNK birthday with a party of special UNK there was much talk and excitement in hobbiton bilbo was very rich and very peculiar and had been the wonder of the shire for sixty years ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return the UNK he had brought back from his UNK had now become a local legend and it was UNK believed whatever the old folk might say that the hill at bag end was full of tunnels UNK with treasure and if that was not enough for UNK there was also his UNK vigour to UNK at time wore on but it seemed to have little effect on mr baggins at UNK he was much the same as at fifty at ninety-nine they began to call him UNK but UNK would have been nearer the mark there were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing it seemed UNK that anyone should possess UNK UNK youth as well as UNK UNK wealth it will have to be paid for they said it isnt natural and trouble will come of it but so far trouble had not come and as mr baggins was generous with his money most people were willing to forgive him his UNK and his good fortune he remained on UNK UNK with his relatives except of course the sackville-bagginses and he had many UNK UNK among the hobbits of poor and UNK families but he had no close friends until some of his younger UNK began to grow up the eldest of these and bilbos favourite was young frodo baggins when bilbo was ninety-nine he UNK frodo as his heir and brought him to live at bag end and the UNK of the sackville-bagginses were finally dashed bilbo and frodo happened to have the same birthday september UNK you had better come and live here frodo my lad said bilbo one day and then we can UNK our UNK UNK together at that time frodo was still in his UNK as the hobbits called the UNK UNK between UNK and coming of age at UNK twelve more years passed each year the bagginses had given very UNK UNK UNK at bag end but now it was understood that something quite UNK was being UNK for that autumn bilbo was going to be UNK  a rather curious number and a very UNK age for a hobbit the old took himself had only reached  and frodo was going to be UNK  an important number the UNK of his coming of age tongues began to UNK in UNK and by water and rumour of the coming event travelled all over the shire the history and character of mr bilbo baggins became once again the chief UNK of UNK and the older folk suddenly found their UNK in welcome demand no one had a more UNK audience than old UNK gamgee UNK known as the gaffer he held forth at the UNK UNK  a small inn on the bywater road and he spoke with some authority for he had tended the garden at bag end for forty years and had helped old UNK in the same job before that now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the UNK the job was mainly carried on by his UNK son sam gamgee both father and son were on very friendly UNK with bilbo and frodo they lived on the hill itself in number  bagshot row just below bag end a very nice UNK UNK is mr bilbo as ive always said the gaffer declared with perfect truth for bilbo was very polite to him calling him master UNK and UNK him constantly upon the growing of UNK - in the matter of roots especially UNK the gaffer was UNK as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood UNK himself but what about this frodo that lives with him asked old UNK of by water baggins is his name but hes more than half a brandybuck they say it UNK me why any baggins of hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in buckland where folks are so queer and no wonder theyre queer put in UNK UNK the gaffers UNK UNK if they live on the wrong side of the brandywine river and right UNK the old forest thats a dark bad place if half the tales be true youre right UNK said the gaffer not that the brandybucks of UNK live in the old forest but theyre a queer UNK UNK they fool about with boats on that big river - and that isnt natural small wonder that trouble came of it i say but be that as it may mr frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet very much like mr bilbo and in more than looks after all his father was a baggins a UNK UNK hobbit was mr drogo baggins there was never much to tell of him till he was drownded drownded said several voices they had heard this and other darker rumours before of course but hobbits have a UNK for family history and they were ready to hear it again well so they say said the gaffer you see mr drogo he UNK poor miss UNK brandybuck she was our mr bilbos first cousin on the mothers side her UNK being the UNK of the old tooks UNK and mr drogo was his second cousin so mr frodo is his first and second cousin once removed either way as the saying is if you follow me and mr drogo was staying at brandy UNK with his UNK old master UNK as he often did after his UNK him being UNK to his UNK and old UNK keeping a mighty generous table and he went out UNK on the brandywine river and he and his wife were drownded and poor mr frodo only a child and all  ive heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight said old UNK and it was UNK weight as sunk the boat and  heard she pushed him in and he pulled her in after him said UNK man the hobbiton miller you shouldnt listen to all you hear sandyman said the gaffer who did not much like the miller there isnt no call to go talking of pushing and pulling boats are quite UNK enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble anyway there was this mr frodo left an UNK and UNK as you might say among those queer bucklanders being brought up UNK in brandy hall a UNK UNK by all accounts old master UNK never had UNK than a couple of hundred relations in the place mr bilbo never did a UNK deed than when he brought the lad back to live among UNK folk but i reckon it was a nasty UNK for those sackville-bagginses they thought they were going to get bag end that time when he went off and was thought to be dead and then he comes back and orders them off and he goes on living and living and never looking a day older bless him and suddenly he UNK an heir and has all the UNK made out proper the sackville-bagginses wont never see the inside of bag end now or it is to be hoped not theres a UNK bit of money UNK away up there i hear tell said a stranger a UNK on business from michel delving in the UNK all the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with UNK of gold and silver and UNK by what ive heard  then youve heard more than i can speak to answered the gaffer i know nothing about UNK mr bilbo is free with his money and there seems no lack of it but i know of no tunnel UNK i saw mr bilbo when he came back a matter of sixty years ago when i was a lad id not long come UNK to old UNK him being my UNK cousin but he had me up at bag end UNK him to keep folks from UNK and UNK all over the garden while the sale was on and in the middle of it all mr bilbo comes up the hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of UNK i dont doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in UNK parts where there be mountains of gold they say but there wasnt enough to fill tunnels but my lad sam will know more about that hes in and out of bag end UNK about stories of the old days he is and he UNK to all mr bilbos tales mr bilbo has learned him his letters - meaning no harm mark you and i hope no harm will come of it elves and dragons UNK to him UNK and UNK are better for me and you don t go getting mixed up in the business of your UNK or youll land in trouble too big for you  i says to him and i might say it to others he added with a look at the stranger and the miller but the gaffer did not UNK his audience the legend of bilbos wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger UNK of hobbits ah but he has likely enough been UNK to what he brought at first UNK the miller UNK common UNK hes often away from home and look at the outlandish folk that visit him dwarves coming at night and that old wandering UNK gandalf and all you can say what you like gaffer but bag ends a queer place and its folk are UNK and you can say what you like about what you know no more of than you do of UNK mr sandyman UNK the gaffer UNK the miller even more than usual if thats being queer then we could do with a bit more UNK in these parts theres some not far away that wouldnt offer a UNK of beer to a friend if they lived in a hole with golden walls but they do things proper at bag end our sam says that UNK going to be invited to the party and theres going to be presents mark you presents for all - this very month as is that very month was september and as fine as you could ask a day or two later a rumour probably started by the UNK sam was spread about that there were going to be fireworks - fireworks what is more such as had not been seen in the shire for nigh on a UNK not indeed since the old took died days passed and the day drew nearer an UNK waggon laden with UNK UNK rolled into hobbiton one evening and UNK up the hill to bag end the startled hobbits peered out of UNK doors to UNK at it it was driven by outlandish folk singing strange songs dwarves with long UNK and deep UNK a few of them remained at bag end at the end of the second week in september a UNK came in through bywater from the direction of the brandywine bridge in broad daylight an old man was driving it all alone he wore a tall pointed blue hat a long grey cloak and a silver UNK he had a long white beard and UNK UNK that stuck out beyond the UNK of his hat small UNK ran after the UNK all through hobbiton and right up the hill it had a UNK of fireworks as they rightly guessed at bilbos front door the old man began to UNK there were great UNK of fireworks of all sorts and shapes each UNK with a large red g and the UNK  that was gandalf s mark of course and the old man was gandalf the wizard whose UNK in the shire was due mainly to his skill with UNK UNK and lights his real business was far more difficult and dangerous but the shire-folk knew nothing about it to them he was just one of the UNK at the party UNK the excitement of the UNK g for UNK they shouted and the old man smiled they knew him by sight though he only appeared in hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long but neither they nor any but the oldest of their UNK had seen one of his UNK UNK - they now belonged to the UNK past when the old man helped by bilbo and some dwarves had finished UNK bilbo gave a few UNK away but not a single UNK or UNK was UNK to the UNK of the UNK run away now said gandalf you will get plenty when the time comes then he disappeared inside with bilbo and the door was shut the young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while and then made off feeling that the day of the party would never come inside bag end bilbo and gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking out west on to the garden the late afternoon was bright and peaceful the flowers glowed red and golden UNK and UNK and UNK UNK all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round windows how bright your garden looks said gandalf yes said bilbo i am very fond indeed of it and of all the dear old shire but i think i need a holiday you mean to go on with your plan then i do i made up my mind months ago and i havent changed it very well it is no good saying any more stick to your plan - your whole plan mind - and i hope it will turn out for the best for you and for all of us i hope so anyway i mean to UNK myself on UNK and have my little joke who will laugh i wonder said gandalf shaking his head we shall see said bilbo the next day more carts rolled up the hill and still more carts there might have been some UNK about UNK UNK but that very week orders began to UNK out of bag end for every kind of UNK UNK or UNK that could be obtained in hobbiton or bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood people became UNK and they began to UNK off the days on the UNK and they watched eagerly for the UNK UNK for invitations before long the invitations began pouring out and the hobbiton UNK was blocked and the bywater UNK was UNK under and UNK UNK UNK were called for there was a UNK stream of them going up the hill carrying hundreds of polite UNK on thank you i shall certainly come a notice appeared on the gate at bag end no UNK except on party business even those who had or UNK to have party business were seldom allowed inside bilbo was busy writing invitations UNK off UNK packing up presents and making some private preparations of his own from the time of gandalf s arrival he remained hidden from view one morning the hobbits woke to find the large field south of bilbos front door covered with ropes and UNK for UNK and UNK a special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road and wide steps and a large white gate were built there the three UNK of bagshot row UNK the field were UNK interested and generally UNK old gaffer gamgee stopped even UNK to work in his garden the UNK began to go up there was a specially large pavilion so big that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it and stood proudly near one end at the head of the chief table lanterns were hung on all its branches more UNK still to the hobbits mind an UNK UNK kitchen was UNK in the north corner of the field a draught of UNK from every inn and UNK for miles around arrived to UNK the dwarves and other odd folk that were UNK at bag end excitement rose to its height then the weather clouded over that was on UNK the UNK of the party anxiety was UNK then UNK september the UNK actually dawned the sun got up the clouds vanished UNK were UNK and the fun began bilbo baggins called it a party but it was really a UNK of UNK rolled into one UNK UNK living near was invited a very few were UNK by accident but as they turned up all the same that did not matter many people from other parts of the shire were also asked and there were even a few from outside the borders bilbo met the guests and UNK at the new white gate in person ele gave away presents to all and UNK - the latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by the gate hobbits give presents to other people on their own UNK not very UNK ones as a rule and not so UNK as on this occasion but it was not a bad UNK actually in hobbiton and bywater every day in the year it was UNK birthday so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week but they never got tired of them on this occasion the presents were unusually good the UNK were so UNK that for a while they almost forgot about eating there were UNK the like of which they had never seen before all beautiful and some obviously UNK many of them had indeed been ordered a year before and had come all the way from the mountain and from dale and were of real UNK when every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate there were songs UNK music UNK and of course food and drink there were three UNK UNK lunch tea and dinner or supper but lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together at other times there were merely lots of people eating and drinking - UNK from UNK until UNK when the fireworks started the fireworks were by gandalf they were not only brought by him but UNK and made by him and the special UNK set pieces and UNK of UNK were let off by him but there was also a generous UNK of UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and thunder UNK they were all UNK the art of gandalf UNK with age there were UNK like a flight of UNK birds singing with sweet voices there were green trees with trunks of dark smoke their leaves opened like a whole spring UNK in a moment and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their UNK faces there were fountains of UNK that flew glittering into the trees there were pillars of UNK UNK that rose and turned into eagles or sailing ships or a UNK of flying swans there was a red UNK and a UNK of yellow rain there was a forest of silver UNK that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an UNK UNK and came down again into the water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes and there was also one last surprise in honour of bilbo and it startled the hobbits exceedingly as gandalf intended the lights went out a great smoke went up it shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance and began to glow at the summit it UNK green and UNK flames out flew a red UNK dragon - not UNK but terribly UNK fire came from his UNK his eyes UNK down there was a roar and he UNK three times over the heads of the crowd they all UNK and many fell flat on their faces the dragon passed like an UNK UNK turned a UNK and burst over bywater with a UNK UNK that is the UNK for supper said bilbo the pain and alarm vanished at once and the UNK hobbits leaped to their feet there was a splendid supper for everyone for everyone that is except those invited to the special family UNK this was held in the great pavilion with the tree the invitations were UNK to twelve UNK a number also called by the hobbits one UNK though the word was not considered proper to use of people and the guests were UNK from all the families to which bilbo and frodo were related with the UNK of a few special UNK friends such as gandalf many young hobbits were included and present by UNK UNK for hobbits were UNK with their children in the matter of sitting up late especially when there was a chance of getting them a free meal bringing up young hobbits took a lot of UNK there were many bagginses and boffins and also many tooks and brandybucks there were various UNK relations of bilbo baggins grandmother and various UNK UNK of his took UNK and selection of UNK bolgers UNK UNK UNK UNK and proudfoots some of these were only very UNK UNK with bilbo and some of them had hardly ever been in hobbiton before as they lived in remote corners of the shire the sackville-bagginses were not forgotten otho and his wife lobelia were present they UNK bilbo and UNK frodo but so UNK was the UNK UNK written in golden UNK that they had felt it was impossible to refuse besides their cousin bilbo had been UNK in food for many years and his table had a high reputation all the one hundred and UNK guests expected a pleasant feast though they rather dreaded the UNK speech of their host an UNK item fie was UNK to UNK in bits of what he called poetry and sometimes after a glass or two would UNK to the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey the guests were not UNK they had a very pleasant feast in fact an UNK UNK rich UNK UNK and UNK the UNK of UNK fell almost to nothing UNK the district in the UNK weeks but as bilbos UNK had UNK the UNK of most UNK UNK and UNK for miles around that did not matter much after the feast more or less came the speech most of the company were however now in a UNK mood at that UNK stage which they called filling up the corners they were UNK their favourite UNK and UNK at their favourite UNK and their fears were forgotten they were prepared to listen to anything and to UNK at every full stop my dear people began bilbo rising in his place UNK UNK hear they shouted and kept on UNK it in chorus seeming reluctant to follow their own advice bilbo left his place and went and stood on a chair under the UNK tree the light of the lanterns fell on his UNK face the golden UNK shone on his UNK UNK UNK they could all see him standing waving one hand in the air the other was in his UNK UNK my dear bagginses and boffins he began again and my dear tooks and brandybucks and UNK and UNK and UNK and UNK and bolgers UNK UNK UNK and proudfoots UNK shouted an UNK hobbit from the back of the pavilion his name of course was proudfoot and well UNK his feet were large UNK UNK and both were on the table proudfoots repeated bilbo also my good sackville-bagginses that i welcome back at last to bag end today is my one hundred and UNK birthday i am UNK UNK today UNK UNK many happy UNK they shouted and they UNK UNK on the tables bilbo was doing UNK this was the sort of stuff they liked short and UNK i hope you are all UNK yourselves as much as i am UNK cheers cries of yes and no noises of UNK and horns UNK and UNK and other UNK UNK there were as has been said many young hobbits present hundreds of UNK UNK had been pulled most of them bore the mark dale on them which did not UNK much to most of the hobbits but they all agreed they were marvellous UNK they contained UNK small but of perfect make and UNK UNK indeed in one corner some of the young tooks and brandybucks UNK uncle bilbo to have finished since he had plainly said all that was necessary now got up an UNK UNK and began a merry UNK master UNK took and miss UNK brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance the UNK a pretty dance but rather UNK but bilbo had not finished UNK a horn from a UNK near by he blew three loud UNK the noise UNK  shall not keep you long he cried cheers from all the UNK  have called you all together for a purpose something in the way that he said this made an UNK there was almost silence and one or two of the tooks UNK up their ears indeed for three purposes first of all to tell you that i am UNK fond of you all and that UNK years is too short a time to live among such excellent and UNK hobbits UNK UNK of UNK  don t know half of you half as well as i should like and i like less than half of you half as well as you deserve this was unexpected and rather difficult there was some scattered clapping but most of them were trying to work it out and see if it came to a UNK UNK to UNK my birthday cheers again i should say our birthday for it is of course also the birthday of my heir and nephew frodo he comes of age and into his UNK today some UNK clapping by the UNK and some loud UNK of frodo frodo jolly old frodo from the UNK the sackville-bagginses UNK and wondered what was meant by coming into his UNK together we UNK one hundred and UNK your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable UNK one UNK if i may use the expression no cheers this was ridiculous many of his guests and especially the sackville-bagginses were UNK feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up the required number like goods in a UNK one UNK indeed UNK expression it is also if i may be allowed to UNK to ancient history the UNK of my arrival by UNK at UNK on the long lake though the fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion i was only UNK then and UNK did not seem so important the UNK was very splendid however though i had a bad cold at the time i remember and could only say UNK very UNK i now repeat it more UNK thank you very much for coming to my little party UNK silence they all feared that a song or some poetry was now UNK and they were getting UNK why couldnt he stop talking and let them drink his health but bilbo did not sing or UNK fie paused for a moment UNK and finally he said i wish to make an UNK fie spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could i regret to UNK that - though as i said UNK years is far too short a time to spend among you - this is the end i am going i am leaving now good-bye  he stepped down and vanished there was a blinding flash of light and the guests all UNK when they opened their eyes bilbo was nowhere to be seen one hundred and UNK UNK hobbits sat back UNK old UNK proudfoot removed his feet from the table and UNK then there was a dead silence until suddenly after several deep UNK every baggins boffin took brandybuck UNK UNK UNK bolger UNK UNK UNK UNK and proudfoot began to talk at once it was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad UNK and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of UNK and UNK hes mad i always said so was probably the most UNK UNK even the tooks with a few UNK thought bilbos UNK was absurd for the moment most of them took it for UNK that his disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous UNK but old UNK brandybuck was not so sure neither age nor an UNK dinner had clouded his wits and he said to his UNK UNK theres something UNK in this my dear i believe that mad baggins is off again silly old fool but why worry he hasnt taken the UNK with him he called loudly to frodo to send the wine round again frodo was the only one present who had said nothing for some time he had sat silent beside bilbos empty chair and UNK all UNK and questions he had enjoyed the joke of course even though he had been in the know he had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the UNK surprise of the guests but at the same time he felt deeply troubled he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly most of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing bilbo baggins UNK past and present but the sackville-bagginses had already departed in wrath frodo did not want to have any more to do with the party he gave orders for more wine to be served then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the health of bilbo and slipped out of the pavilion as for bilbo baggins even while he was making his speech he had been fingering the golden ring in his pocket his magic ring that he had kept secret for so many years as he stepped down he slipped it on his finger and he was never seen by any hobbit in hobbiton again he walked UNK back to his hole and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the UNK in the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field then he went in he took off his party clothes UNK up and wrapped in UNK his UNK UNK UNK and put it away then he put on quickly some old UNK garments and fastened round his UNK a worn leather belt on it he hung a short sword in a UNK UNK UNK from a locked UNK smelling of UNK he took out an old cloak and hood they had been locked up as if they were very precious but they were so UNK and UNK that their original colour could hardly be guessed it might have been dark green they were rather too large for him he then went into his study and from a large UNK took out a UNK wrapped in old UNK and a leather UNK UNK and also a large UNK envelope the book and UNK he UNK into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there already nearly full into the envelope he slipped his golden ring and its fine chain and then UNK it and UNK it to frodo at first he put it on the mantelpiece but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket at that moment the door opened and gandalf came quickly in hullo said bilbo i wondered if you would turn up i am glad to find you visible replied the wizard sitting down in a chair i wanted to catch you and have a few final words i suppose you feel that everything has gone off UNK and according to plan yes i do said bilbo though that flash was UNK it quite startled me let alone the others a little UNK of your own i suppose it was you have UNK kept that ring secret all these years and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to explain your sudden UNK and would UNK my joke you are an UNK old UNK laughed bilbo but i expect you know best as usual i do - when i know anything but i dont feel too sure about this whole affair it has now come to the final point you have had your joke and alarmed or UNK most of your relations and given the whole shire something to talk about for nine days or ninety-nine more likely are you going any further yes i am i feel i need a holiday a very long holiday as i have told you before probably a UNK holiday i dont expect i shall return in fact i dont mean to and i have made all UNK i am old gandalf i dont look it but i am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts UNK indeed he snorted why i feel all thin sort of stretched if you know what i mean like butter that has been UNK over too much bread that cant be right i need a change or something gandalf looked curiously and closely at him no it does not seem right he said thoughtfully no after all i believe your plan is probably the best well ive made up my mind anyway i want to see mountains again gandalf mountains and then find somewhere where i can rest in peace and quiet without a lot of relatives UNK around and a string of UNK UNK hanging on the bell i might find somewhere where i can finish my book i have thought of a nice ending for it and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days  gandalf laughed i hope he will but nobody will read the book however it ends oh they may in years to come frodo has read some already as far as it has gone youll keep an eye on frodo wont you yes i will - two eyes as often as i can spare them he would come with me of course if i asked him in fact he offered to once just before the party but he does not really want to yet i want to see the wild country again before i die and the mountains but he is still in love with the shire with woods and fields and little rivers he ought to be comfortable here i am leaving everything to him of course except a few UNK i hope he will be happy when he UNK used to being on his own its time he was his own master now everything said gandalf the ring as well you agreed to that you remember well UNK yes i suppose so stammered bilbo where is it in an envelope if you must know said bilbo impatiently there on the mantelpiece well no here it is in my pocket he hesitated isnt that odd now he said softly to himself yet after all why not why shouldnt it stay there gandalf looked again very hard at bilbo and there was a gleam in his eyes i think bilbo he said quietly i should leave it behind dont you want to well yes - and no now it comes to it i dont like parting with it at all i may say and i dont really see why i should why do you want me to he asked and a curious change came over his voice it was sharp with suspicion and UNK you are always UNK me about my ring but you have never UNK me about the other things that i got on my journey no but i had to UNK you said gandalf i wanted the truth it was important magic rings are - well UNK and they are rare and curious i was UNK interested in your ring you may say and i still am i should like to know where it is if you go wandering again also i think you have had it quite long enough you wont need it any more bilbo unless i am quite UNK bilbo UNK and there was an angry light in his eyes his kindly face grew hard why not he cried and what business is it of yours anyway to know what i do with my own things it is my own i found it it came to me yes yes said gandalf but there is no need to get angry if i am it is your fault said bilbo it is mine i tell you my own my precious yes my precious the wizards face remained grave and UNK and only a UNK in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed it has been called that before he said but not by you but i say it now and why not even if gollum said the same once its not his now but mine and i shall keep it i say gandalf stood up he spoke UNK you will be a fool if you do bilbo he said you make that clearer with every word you say it has got far too much hold on you let it go and then you can go yourself and be free ill do as i choose and go as i please said bilbo UNK now now my dear hobbit  said gandalf all your long life we have been friends and you UNK me something come do as you promised give it up  well if you want my ring yourself say so cried bilbo but you wont get it i wont give my precious away i tell you his hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword gandalf s eyes flashed it will be my turn to get angry soon he said if you say that again i shall then you will see gandalf the grey UNK he took a step towards the hobbit and he seemed to grow tall and menacing his shadow filled the little room bilbo UNK away to the wall breathing hard his hand clutching at his pocket they stood for a while facing one another and the air of the room UNK gandalf s eyes remained bent on the hobbit slowly his hands UNK and he began to tremble i dont know what has come over you gandalf he said you have never been like this before what is it all about it is mine isnt it i found it and gollum would have killed me if i hadnt kept it im not a thief whatever he said i have never called you one gandalf answered and i am not one either i am not trying to UNK you but to help you i wish you would trust me as you used he turned away and the shadow passed he seemed to UNK again to an old grey man bent and troubled bilbo drew his hand over his eyes i am sorry he said but i felt so queer and yet it would be a relief in a way not to be UNK with it any more it has been so growing on my mind lately sometimes i have felt it was like an eye looking at me and i am always wanting to put it on and UNK dont you know or wondering if it is safe and pulling it out to make sure i tried UNK it up but i found i couldnt rest without it in my pocket i dont know why and i dont seem able to make up my mind then trust mine said gandalf it is quite made up go away and leave it behind stop UNK it give it to frodo and i will look after him bilbo stood for a moment UNK and UNK presently he sighed all right he said with an effort i will then he UNK his shoulders and smiled rather UNK after all thats what this party business was all about really to give away lots of birthday presents and somehow make it easier to give it away at the same time it hasnt made it any easier in the end but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations it would quite UNK the joke indeed it would take away the only point i ever saw in the affair said gandalf very well said bilbo it goes to frodo with all the rest he drew a deep breath and now i really must be starting or UNK else will catch me i have said good-bye and i couldnt bear to do it all over again he picked up his bag and moved to the door you have still got the ring in your pocket said the wizard well so i have cried bilbo and my will and all the other UNK too you had better take it and UNK it for me that will be UNK no dont give the ring to me said gandalf put it on the mantelpiece it will be safe enough there till frodo comes i shall wait for him bilbo took out the envelope but just as he was about to set it by the UNK his hand UNK back and the UNK fell on the floor before he could pick it up the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place a UNK of anger passed swiftly over the hobbits face again suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh well thats that he said now im off they went out into the hall bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand then he whistled three dwarves came out of different rooms where they had been busy is everything ready asked bilbo everything packed and UNK everything they answered well lets start then he stepped out of the UNK it was a fine night and the black sky was UNK with stars he looked up sniffing the air what fun what fun to be off again off on the road with dwarves  this is what i have really been longing for for years  good-bye  he said looking at his old home and bowing to the door good-bye gandalf good-bye for the present bilbo take care of yourself you are old enough and perhaps wise enough take care i dont care dont you worry about me i am as happy now as i have ever been and that is saying a great deal but the time has come i am being swept off my feet at last he added and then in a low voice as if to himself he sang softly in the dark the road goes ever on and on down from the door where it began now far ahead the road has gone and i must follow if i can pursuing it with eager feet until it UNK some larger way where many paths and UNK meet and whither then i cannot say he paused silent for a moment then without another word he turned away from the lights and voices in the fields and UNK and followed by his three companions went round into his garden and trotted down the long sloping path he jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom and took to the meadows passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the grass gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness UNK my dear bilbo - until our next meeting he said softly and went back indoors frodo came in soon afterwards and found him sitting in the dark deep in thought has he gone he asked yes answered gandalf he has gone at last  i wish -  mean i hoped until this evening that it was only a joke said frodo but i knew in my heart that he really meant to go he always used to joke about serious things i wish i had come back sooner just to see him off i think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end said gandalf dont be too troubled hell be all right - now he left a UNK for you there it is frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece and glanced at it but did not open it youll find his will and all the other UNK in there i think said the wizard you are the master of bag end now and also i fancy youll find a golden ring the ring exclaimed frodo has he left me that i wonder why still it may be useful it may and it may not said gandalf i should not make use of it if i were you but keep it secret and keep it safe now i am going to bed as master of bag end frodo felt it his painful UNK to say good-bye to the guests rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field but frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning about midnight UNK came for the important folk one by one they rolled away filled with full but very UNK hobbits UNK came by UNK and removed in UNK those that had UNK remained behind night slowly passed the sun rose the hobbits rose rather later morning went on people came and began by orders to clear away the UNK and the tables and the chairs and the spoons and knives and bottles and UNK and the lanterns and the UNK UNK in UNK and the UNK and UNK UNK the forgotten bags and UNK and UNK and the UNK food a very small item then a number of other people came without orders bagginses and boffins and bolgers and tooks and other guests that lived or were staying near by mid-day when even the UNK were out and about again there was a large crowd at bag end UNK but not unexpected frodo was waiting on the step smiling but looking rather tired and worried he welcomed all the UNK but he had not much more to say than before his reply to all UNK was simply this mr bilbo baggins has gone away as far as i know for good some of the UNK he invited to come inside as bilbo had left messages for them inside in the hall there was piled a large UNK of UNK and UNK and small UNK of UNK on every item there was a UNK UNK there were several UNK of this sort for UNK took for his very own from bilbo on an UNK UNK had carried off many UNK ones for UNK baggins in memory of a long UNK with love from bilbo on a large UNK basket UNK was UNK UNK and the eldest UNK UNK UNK of bilbo and frodo she was ninety-nine and had written UNK of good advice for more than half a UNK for UNK UNK UNK it will be useful from UNK on a gold UNK and UNK UNK never answered letters for UNK use from uncle bilbo on a round UNK mirror she was a young baggins and too obviously considered her face UNK for the UNK of UNK UNK from a UNK on an empty book UNK UNK was a great UNK of books and worse than usual at returning them for lobelia UNK as a present on a case of silver spoons bilbo believed that she had UNK a good many of his spoons while he was away on his former journey UNK knew that quite well when she arrived later in the day she took the point at once but she also took the spoons this is only a small selection of the UNK presents bilbos UNK had got rather UNK up with things in the course of his long life it was a UNK of UNK to get UNK up for which the custom of giving so many UNK was largely UNK not of course that the UNK were always new there were one or two old UNK of forgotten uses that had UNK all around the district but bilbo had usually given new presents and kept those that he received the old hole was now being cleared a little every one of the various parting gifts had UNK written out UNK by bilbo and several had some point or some joke but of course most of the things were given where they would be wanted and welcome the UNK hobbits and especially those of bagshot row did very well old gaffer gamgee got two UNK of UNK a new UNK a UNK UNK and a UNK of UNK for creaking UNK old UNK brandybuck in return for much UNK got a UNK bottles of old UNK a strong red wine from the southfarthing and now quite UNK as it had been laid down by bilbos father UNK quite UNK bilbo and UNK him a UNK fellow after the first UNK there was plenty of everything left for frodo and of course all the chief treasures as well as the books UNK and more than enough UNK were left in his UNK there was however no sign nor mention of money or UNK not a UNK UNK or a glass UNK was given away frodo had a very trying time that afternoon a false rumour that the whole household was being UNK free spread like UNK and before long the place was packed with people who had no business there but could not be kept out UNK got UNK off and mixed and UNK broke out some people tried to do UNK and UNK in the hall and others tried to make off with UNK UNK not UNK to them or with anything that seemed UNK or UNK the road to the gate was blocked with barrows and UNK in the middle of the UNK the sackville-bagginses arrived frodo had UNK for a while and left his friend merry brandybuck to keep an eye on things when otho loudly demanded to see frodo merry bowed UNK he is UNK he said he is UNK hiding you mean said UNK anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him just go and tell him so merry left them a long while in the hall and they had time to discover their parting gift of spoons it did not UNK their UNK eventually they were shown into the study frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of UNK in front of him he looked UNK - to see sackville-bagginses at any rate and he stood up UNK with something in his pocket but he spoke quite UNK the sackville-bagginses were rather UNK they began by UNK him bad UNK as between friends for various UNK and UNK things when frodo replied that only the things specially UNK by bilbo were being given away they said the whole affair was very UNK only one thing is clear to me said otho and that is that you are doing exceedingly well out of it i UNK on seeing the will otho would have been bilbos heir but for the UNK of frodo he read the will carefully and snorted it was UNK very clear and UNK according to the UNK UNK of hobbits which demand among other things seven UNK of UNK in red UNK UNK again he said to his wife and after waiting sixty years spoons UNK he UNK his fingers under frodos nose and UNK off but lobelia was not so easily got rid of a little later frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on and found her still about the place UNK UNK and UNK and tapping the UNK he UNK her firmly off the UNK after he had relieved her of several small but rather UNK UNK that had somehow fallen inside her UNK her face looked as if she was in the UNK of thinking out a really UNK parting remark but all she found to say turning round on the step was youll live to regret it young fellow why didnt you go too you dont belong here youre no baggins - you - youre a brandybuck did you hear that merry that was an UNK if you like said frodo as he shut the door on her it was a UNK said merry brandybuck and so of course not true then they went round the hole and UNK three young hobbits two boffins and a bolger who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the UNK frodo also had a UNK with young UNK proudfoot old UNK proudfoots UNK who had begun an UNK in the larger UNK where he thought there was an echo the legend of bilbos gold UNK both curiosity and hope for UNK gold UNK obtained if not UNK UNK is as every one knows any ones for the finding UNK the search is interrupted when he had overcome UNK and pushed him out frodo UNK on chair in the hall its time to close the UNK merry he said lock the door and dont open it to anyone today not even if they bring a UNK UNK then he went to UNK himself with a UNK cup of tea he had hardly sat down when there came a soft knock at the UNK lobelia again most likely he thought she must have thought of something really nasty and have come back again to say it it can wait he went on with his tea the knock was repeated much louder but he took no notice suddenly the wizards head appeared at the window if you dont let me in frodo i shall blow your door right down your hole and out through the hill he said my dear gandalf half a minute cried frodo running out of the room to the door come in come in i thought it was lobelia then i forgive you but i saw her some time ago driving a UNK towards bywater with a face that would have UNK new UNK she had already nearly UNK me UNK i nearly tried on bilbos ring i longed to UNK dont do that said gandalf sitting down do be careful of that ring frodo  in fact it is partly about that that i have come to say a last word well what about it what do you know already only what bilbo told me i have heard his story how he found it and how he used it on his journey i mean which story i wonder said gandalf oh not what he told the dwarves and put in his book said frodo he told me the true story soon after i came to live here he said you had UNK him till he told you so i had better know too no secrets between us frodo he said but they are not to go any further its mine anyway thats UNK said gandalf well what did you think of it all if you mean UNK all that about a present well i thought the true story much more likely and i couldnt see the point of UNK it at all it was very UNK bilbo to do so anyway and i thought it rather odd so did i but odd things may happen to people that have such treasures - if they use them let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it it may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to i dont understand said frodo neither do i answered the wizard i have merely begun to wonder about the ring especially since last night no need to worry but if you take my advice you will use it very seldom or not at all at least i beg you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or UNK suspicion i say again keep it safe and keep it secret you are very mysterious what are you afraid of i am not certain so i will say no more i may be able to tell you something when i come back i am going off at once so this is good-bye for the present he got up at once cried frodo why i thought you were staying on for at least a week i was looking forward to your help i did mean to - but i have had to change my mind i may be away for a good while but ill come and see you again as soon as i can expect me when you see me i shall slip in quietly i shant often be UNK the shire openly again i find that i have become rather UNK they say i am a nuisance and a UNK of the peace some people are actually UNK me of UNK bilbo away or worse if you want to know there is supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth some people exclaimed frodo you mean otho and lobelia how abominable i would give them bag end and everything else if i could get bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with him i love the shire but i begin to wish somehow that i had gone too i wonder if i shall ever see him again so do i said gandalf and i wonder many other things good-bye now take care of yourself UNK for me especially at unlikely times  good-bye frodo saw him to the door he gave a final wave of his hand and walked off at a UNK pace but frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent almost as if he was carrying a great weight the evening was closing in and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight frodo did not see him again for a long time chapter   the shadow of the past the talk did not die down in nine or even UNK UNK days the second disappearance of mr bilbo baggins was discussed in hobbiton and indeed all over the shire for a year and a day and was remembered much longer than that it became a fireside UNK for young hobbits and eventually mad baggins who used to vanish with a UNK and a flash and UNK with bags of jewels and gold became a favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the true events were forgotten but in the meantime the general UNK in the neighbourhood was that bilbo who had always been rather cracked had at last gone quite mad and had run off into the blue there he had UNK fallen into a pool or a river and come to a UNK but hardly an UNK end the blame was mostly laid on gandalf if only that UNK wizard will leave young frodo alone perhaps hell settle down and grow some UNK they said and to all appearance the wizard did leave frodo alone and he did settle down but the UNK of UNK was not very UNK indeed he at once began to carry on bilbos reputation for UNK he refused to go into UNK and the next year he gave a party in honour of bilbos UNK birthday which he called UNK feast but that was short of the mark for twenty guests were invited and there were several UNK at which it UNK food and UNK drink as hobbits say some people were rather UNK but frodo kept up the custom of giving bilbos birthday party year after year until they got used to it he said that he did not think bilbo was dead when they asked where is he then he UNK his shoulders he lived alone as bilbo had done but he had a good many friends especially among the younger hobbits mostly UNK of the old took who had as children been fond of bilbo and often in and out of bag end UNK boffin and fredegar bolger were two of these but his UNK friends were peregrin took usually called pippin and merry brandybuck his real name was meriadoc but that was seldom remembered frodo went tramping all over the shire with them but more often he wandered by himself and to the amazement of UNK folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight merry and pippin UNK that he visited the elves at times as bilbo had done as time went on people began to notice that frodo also showed signs of good UNK UNK he UNK the appearance of a UNK and UNK hobbit just out of his UNK some folk have all the luck they said but it was not until frodo approached the usually more UNK age of fifty that they began to think it queer frodo himself after the first UNK found that being his own master and the mr baggins of bag end was rather pleasant for some years he was quite happy and did not worry much about the future but half unknown to himself the regret that he had not gone with bilbo was steadily growing he found himself wondering at times especially in the autumn about the wild lands and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his dreams he began to say to himself perhaps i shall cross the river myself one day to which the other half of his mind always replied not yet so it went on until his UNK were running out and his fiftieth birthday was drawing near fifty was a number that he felt was somehow UNK or ominous it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen bilbo frodo began to feel restless and the old paths seemed too UNK he looked at maps and wondered what lay beyond their edges maps made in the shire showed mostly white UNK beyond its borders he took to wandering further UNK and more often by himself and merry and his other friends watched him anxiously often he was seen walking and talking with the strange UNK that began at this time to appear in the shire there were rumours of strange things UNK in the world outside and as gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years frodo gathered all the news he could elves who seldom walked in the shire could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening passing and not returning but they were leaving middle-earth and were no longer concerned with its troubles there were however dwarves on the road in UNK numbers the ancient east UNK road ran through the shire to its end at the grey havens and dwarves had always used it on their way to their mines in the blue mountains they were the hobbits chief source of news from distant parts - if they wanted any as a rule dwarves said little and hobbits asked no more but now frodo often met strange dwarves of far UNK seeking refuge in the west they were troubled and some spoke in whispers of the enemy and of the land of mordor that name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past like a shadow in the UNK of their memories but it was ominous and UNK it seemed that the evil power in mirkwood had been driven out by the white council only to UNK in greater strength in the old UNK of mordor the dark tower had been UNK it was said from there the power was spreading far and wide and away far east and south there were wars and growing fear ores were UNK again in the mountains trolls were abroad no longer UNK but cunning and UNK with dreadful weapons and there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these but they had no name little of all this of course reached the ears of ordinary hobbits but even the UNK and most UNK began to hear queer tales and those whose business took them to the borders saw strange things the UNK in the green dragon at bywater one evening in the spring of frodos fiftieth year showed that even in the comfortable heart of the shire rumours had been heard though most hobbits still laughed at them sam gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire and UNK him was ted sandyman the UNK son and there were various other UNK hobbits listening to their talk queer things you do hear these days to be sure said sam ah said ted you do if you listen but i can hear UNK and UNK stories at home if i want to no doubt you can UNK sam and i daresay theres more truth in some of them than you reckon who UNK the stories anyway take dragons now no thank UNK said ted i wont i heard tell of them when i was a UNK but theres no call to believe in them now theres only one dragon in by water and thats green he said getting a general laugh all right said sam laughing with the rest but what about these UNK these giants as you might call them they do say that one UNK than a tree was seen up away beyond the north moors not long back UNK UNK my cousin UNK for one he works for mr boffin at UNK and goes up to the UNK for the hunting he saw one says he did perhaps your UNK always saying hes seen things and maybe he UNK things that aint there but this one was as big as an elm tree and walking - walking seven yards to a UNK if it was an inch then i UNK it wasnt an inch what he saw was an elm tree as like as not but this one was walking i tell you and there aint no elm tree on the north moors then UNK cant have seen one said ted there was some laughing and clapping the audience seemed to think that ted had scored a point all the same said sam you cant deny that others besides our UNK have seen queer folk crossing the shire - crossing it mind you there are more that are turned back at the borders the UNK have never been so busy before and ive heard tell that elves are moving west they do say they are going to the UNK out away beyond the white towers sam waved his arm UNK neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the sea past the old towers beyond the western borders of the shire but it was an old UNK that away over there stood the grey havens from which at times UNK set sail never to return they are sailing sailing sailing over the sea they are going into the west and leaving us said sam half UNK the words shaking his head sadly and solemnly but ted laughed well that isnt anything new if you believe the old tales and i dont see what it matters to me or you let them sail but i UNK you havent seen them doing it nor any one else in the shire well i dont know said sam thoughtfully he believed he had once seen an elf in the woods and still hoped to see more one day of all the legends that he had heard in his early years such UNK of tales and UNK stories about the elves as the hobbits knew had always moved him most deeply there are some even in these parts as know the fair folk and get news of them he said theres mr baggins now that i work for he told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about elves and old mr bilbo knew more UNK the talk i had with him when i was a little lad oh theyre both cracked said ted UNK old bilbo was cracked and frodos UNK if thats where you get your news from youll never want for UNK well friends im off home your good health he drained his mug and went out UNK sam sat silent and said no more he had a good deal to think about for one thing there was a lot to do up in the bag end garden and he would have a busy day tomorrow if the weather cleared the grass was growing fast but sam had more on his mind than UNK after a while he sighed and got up and went out it was early UNK and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain the sun was down and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night he walked home under the early stars through hobbiton and up the hill whistling softly and thoughtfully it was just at this time that gandalf reappeared after his long UNK for three years after the party he had been away then he paid frodo a brief visit and after taking a good look at him he went off again during the next year or two he had turned up fairly often coming unexpectedly after dusk and going off without warning before sunrise he would not UNK his own business and journeys and seemed chiefly interested in small news about frodos health and doings then suddenly his UNK had ceased it was over nine years since frodo had seen or heard of him and he had begun to think that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits but that evening as sam was walking home and twilight was fading there came the once familiar UNK on the study window frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight they looked hard at one another ah well eh said gandalf you look the same as ever frodo so do you frodo replied but secretly he thought that gandalf looked older and more UNK he pressed him for news of himself and of the wide world and soon they were deep in talk and they stayed up far into the night next morning after a late breakfast the wizard was sitting with frodo by the open window of the study a bright fire was on the hearth but the sun was warm and the wind was in the south everything looked fresh and the new green of spring was shimmering in the fields and on the UNK of the trees fingers gandalf was thinking of a spring nearly UNK years before when bilbo had run out of bag end without a UNK his hair was perhaps UNK than it had been then and his beard and UNK were perhaps longer and his face more lined with care and wisdom but his eyes were as bright as ever and he UNK and blew smoke UNK with the same vigour and delight he was smoking now in silence for frodo was sitting still deep in thought even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings that gandalf had brought at last he broke the silence last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring gandalf he said and then you stopped because you said that such matters were best left until daylight dont you think you had better finish now you say the ring is dangerous far more dangerous than i guess in what way in many ways answered the wizard it is far more powerful than i ever dared to think at first so powerful that in the end it would UNK overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it it would possess him in eregion long ago many UNK were made magic rings as you call them and they were of course of various kinds some more UNK and some less the lesser rings were only UNK in the craft before it was UNK and to the UNK they were but UNK - yet still to my mind dangerous for mortals but the great rings the rings of power they were perilous a mortal frodo who UNK one of the great rings does not die but he does not grow or UNK more life he merely UNK until at last every minute is a weariness and if he often uses the ring to make himself invisible he UNK he becomes in the end invisible UNK and UNK in the twilight under the eye of the dark power that rules the rings yes sooner or later - later if he is strong or UNK to begin with but neither strength nor good purpose will last - sooner or later the dark power will UNK him how UNK said frodo there was another long silence the sound of sam gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden how long have you known this asked frodo at length and how much did bilbo know bilbo knew no more than he told you i am sure said gandalf he would certainly never have passed on to you anything that he thought would be a danger even though i promised to look after you he thought the ring was very beautiful and very useful at need and if anything was wrong or queer it was himself he said that it was growing on his mind and he was always worrying about it but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to blame though he had found out that the thing needed looking after it did not seem always of the same size or weight it shrank or UNK in an odd way and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight yes he UNK me of that in his last letter said frodo so i have always kept it on its chain very wise said gandalf but as for his long life bilbo never UNK it with the ring at all he took all the UNK for that to himself and he was very proud of it though he was getting restless and uneasy thin and stretched he said a sign that the ring was getting UNK how long have you known all this asked frodo again known said gandalf i have known much that only the wise know frodo but if you mean known about this ring well i still do not know one might say there is a last test to make but i no longer doubt my guess when did i first begin to guess he UNK searching back in memory let me see - it was in the year that the white council drove the dark power from mirkwood just before the battle of five armies that bilbo found his ring a shadow fell on my heart then though i did not know yet what i feared i wondered often how gollum came by a great ring as plainly it was - that at least was clear from the first then i heard bilbos strange story of how he had won it and i could not believe it when i at last got the truth out of him i saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to the ring beyond doubt much like gollum with his birthday present the lies were too much alike for my comfort clearly the ring had an UNK power that set to work on its keeper at once that was the first real warning i had that all was not well i told bilbo often that such rings were better left UNK but he UNK it and soon got angry there was little else that i could do i could not take it from him without doing greater harm and i had no right to do so anyway i could only watch and wait i might perhaps have UNK saruman the white but something always held me back who is he asked frodo i have never heard of him before maybe not answered gandalf hobbits are or were no concern of his yet he is great among the wise he is the chief of my order and the head of the council his knowledge is deep but his UNK has grown with it and he takes ill any UNK the lore of the UNK great and small is his UNK he has long studied it seeking the lost secrets of their making but when the rings were UNK in the council all that he would reveal to us of his UNK told against my fears so my doubt slept - but uneasily still i watched and i waited and all seemed well with bilbo and the years passed yes they passed and they seemed not to touch him he showed no signs of age the shadow fell on me again but i said to myself after all he comes of a UNK family on his mothers side there is time yet wait and i waited until that night when he left this house he said and did things then that filled me with a fear that no words of saruman could UNK i knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work and i have spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it there wasnt any UNK harm done was there asked frodo anxiously he would get all right in time wouldnt he be able to rest in peace i mean he felt better at once said gandalf but there is only one power in this world that knows all about the rings and their UNK and as far as i know there is no power in the world that knows all about hobbits among the wise i am the only one that goes in for UNK an UNK branch of knowledge but full of UNK soft as butter they can be and yet sometimes as tough as old UNK i think it likely that some would resist the rings far longer than most of the wise would believe i dont think you need worry about bilbo of course he possessed the ring for many years and used it so it might take a long while for the UNK to wear off - before it was safe for him to see it again for instance otherwise he might live on for years quite happily just stop as he was when he UNK with it for he gave it up in the end of his own UNK an important point no i was not troubled about dear bilbo any more once he had let the thing go it is for you that i feel UNK ever since bilbo left i have been deeply concerned about you and about all these UNK absurd UNK hobbits it would be a grievous blow to the world if the dark power overcame the shire if all your kind jolly stupid bolgers UNK boffins UNK and the rest not to mention the ridiculous bagginses became UNK frodo shuddered but why should we be he asked and why should he want such UNK to tell you the truth replied gandalf i believe that UNK - UNK mark you - he has entirely UNK the UNK of hobbits you should be UNK but your safety has passed he does not need you - he has many more useful servants - but he wont forget you again and hobbits as miserable UNK would please him far more than hobbits happy and free there is such a thing as malice and revenge revenge said frodo revenge for what i still dont understand what all this has to do with bilbo and myself and our ring it has everything to do with it said gandalf you do not know the real peril yet but you shall i was not sure of it myself when i was last here but the time has come to speak give me the ring for a moment frodo took it from his UNK where it was UNK to a chain that hung from his belt he UNK it and handed it slowly to the wizard it felt suddenly very heavy as if either it or frodo himself was in some way reluctant for gandalf to touch it gandalf held it up it looked to be made of UNK and solid gold can you see any UNK on it he asked no said frodo there are none it is quite plain and it never UNK a UNK or sign of wear well then look to frodos astonishment and UNK the wizard threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire frodo gave a cry and groped for the UNK but gandalf held him back wait he said in a commanding voice giving frodo a quick look from under his bristling brows no UNK change came over the ring after a while gandalf got up closed the shutters outside the window and drew the curtains the room became dark and silent though the UNK of sams shears now nearer to the windows could still be heard faintly from the garden for a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire then he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth with the UNK and at once picked it up frodo gasped it is quite cool said gandalf take it frodo received it on his UNK UNK it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever hold it up said gandalf and look closely as frodo did so he now saw fine lines UNK than the UNK UNK running along the ring outside and inside lines of fire that seemed to form the letters of a flowing script they shone UNK bright and yet remote as if out of a great UNK i cannot read the fiery letters said frodo in a UNK voice no said gandalf but i can the letters are elvish of an ancient UNK but the language is that of mordor which i will not UNK here but this in the common tongue is what is said close enough one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them it is only two lines of a UNK long known in UNK three rings for the UNK under the sky seven for the UNK in their halls of stone nine for mortal men UNK to die one for the dark lord on his dark throne in the land of mordor where the shadows lie one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them in the land of mordor where the shadows lie  he paused and then said slowly in a deep voice this is the master UNK the one ring to rule them all this is the one ring that he lost many ages ago to the great UNK of his power he greatly desires it - but he must not get it frodo sat silent and UNK fear seemed to UNK out a vast hand like a dark cloud rising in the east and UNK up to UNK him this ring he stammered how how on earth did it come to me ah said gandalf that is a very long story the beginnings lie back in the black years which only the UNK now remember if i were to tell you all that tale we should still be sitting here when spring had passed into winter but last night i told you of sauron the great the dark lord the rumours that you have heard are true he has indeed arisen again and left his hold in mirkwood and returned to his ancient UNK in the dark tower of mordor that name even you hobbits have heard of like a shadow on the borders of old stories always after a defeat and a UNK the shadow takes another shape and grows again i wish it need not have happened in my time said frodo so do i said gandalf and so do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us and already frodo our time is beginning to look black the enemy is fast becoming very strong his plans are far from ripe i think but they are UNK we shall be hard put to it we should be very hard put to it even if it were not for this dreadful chance the enemy still UNK one thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat down all UNK break the last UNK and cover all the lands in a second darkness he UNK the one ring the three fairest of all the elf-lords hid from him and his hand never touched them or UNK them seven the UNK possessed but three he has UNK and the others the dragons have UNK nine he gave to mortal men proud and great and so UNK them long ago they fell under the dominion of the one and they became ringwraiths shadows under his great shadow his most terrible servants long ago it is many a year since the nine walked abroad yet who knows as the shadow grows once more they too may walk again but come we will not speak of such things even in the morning of the shire so it is now the nine he has gathered to himself the seven also or else they are destroyed the three are hidden still but that no longer troubles him he only needs the one for he made that ring himself it is his and he let a great part of his own former power pass into it so that he could rule all the others if he UNK it then he will command them all again wherever they be even the three and all that has been wrought with them will be laid bare and he will be stronger than ever and this is the dreadful chance frodo he believed that the one had perished that the elves had destroyed it as should have been done but he knows now that it has not perished that it has been found so he is seeking it seeking it and all his thought is bent on it it is his great hope and our great fear why why wasnt it destroyed cried frodo and how did the enemy ever come to lose it if he was so strong and it was so precious to him he clutched the ring in his hand as if he saw already dark fingers stretching out to UNK it it was taken from him said gandalf the strength of the elves to resist him was greater long ago and not all men were UNK from them the men of westernesse came to their aid that is a chapter of ancient history which it might be good to recall for there was sorrow then too and gathering dark but great valour and great deeds that were not wholly vain one day perhaps i will tell you all the tale or you shall hear it told in full by one who knows it best but for the moment since most of all you need to know how this thing came to you and that will be tale enough this is all that i will say it was gil-galad UNK and elendil of westernesse who UNK sauron though they themselves perished in the deed and isildur UNK son cut the ring from saurons hand and took it for his own then sauron was UNK and his spirit fled and was hidden for long years until his shadow took shape again in mirkwood but the ring was lost it fell into the great river anduin and vanished for isildur was UNK north along the east banks of the river and near the gladden fields he was UNK by the ores of the mountains and almost all his folk were slain he leaped into the waters but the ring slipped from his finger as he swam and then the ores saw him and killed him with arrows gandalf paused and there in the dark pools amid the gladden fields he said the ring passed out of knowledge and legend and even so much of its history is known now only to a few and the council of the wise could discover no more but at last i can carry on the story i think UNK after but still very long ago there lived by the banks of the great river on the edge of wilderland a clever UNK and UNK little people i guess they were of hobbit UNK UNK to the fathers of the fathers of the stoors for they loved the river and often swam in it or made little boats of reeds there was among them a family of high UNK for it was large and UNK than most and it was UNK by a grandmother of the folk stern and wise in old lore such as they had the most inquisitive and UNK of that family was called smjagol he was interested in roots and beginnings he dived into deep pools he UNK under trees and growing UNK he UNK into green mounds and he ceased to look up at the hill-tops or the leaves on trees or the flowers opening in the air his head and his eyes were UNK he had a friend called UNK of similar sort UNK UNK but not so quick and strong on a time they took a boat and went down to the gladden fields where there were great beds of UNK and UNK reeds there smjagol got out and went UNK about the banks but deal sat in the boat and UNK suddenly a great fish took his UNK and before he knew where he was he was dragged out and down into the water to the bottom then he let go of his line for he thought he saw something shining in the UNK and holding his breath he UNK at it then up he came UNK with UNK in his hair and a UNK of mud and he swam to the bank and behold when he washed the mud away there in his hand lay a beautiful golden ring and it shone and glittered in the sun so that his heart was glad but smjagol had been watching him from behind a tree and as deal UNK over the ring smjagol came softly up behind give us that deal my love said smjagol over his friends shoulder why said deal  because its my birthday my love and i UNK it said smjagol i dont care said deal i have given you a present already more than i could afford i found this and im going to keep it  oh are you indeed my love said smjagol and he caught deal by the throat and UNK him because the gold looked so bright and beautiful then he put the ring on his finger no one ever found out what had become of deal he was UNK far from home and his body was UNK hidden but smjagol returned alone and he found that none of his family could see him when he was wearing the ring he was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed it and he used it to find out secrets and he put his knowledge to crooked and UNK uses he became UNK and UNK for all that was UNK the ring had given him power according to his UNK it is not to be wondered at that he became very UNK and was UNK when visible by all his relations they kicked him and he bit their feet he took to UNK and going about muttering to himself and gurgling in his throat so they called him gollum and cursed him and told him to go far away and his grandmother UNK peace UNK him from the family and turned him out of her hole he wandered in loneliness weeping a little for the UNK of the world and he journeyed up the river till he came to a stream that flowed down from the mountains and he went that way he caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them UNK one day it was very hot and as he was bending over a pool he felt a burning on the back of his head and a UNK light from the water UNK his wet eyes he wondered at it for he had almost forgotten about the sun then for the last time he looked up and shook his UNK at her but as he UNK his eyes he saw far above the UNK of the misty mountains out of which the stream came and he thought suddenly it would be cool and UNK under those mountains the sun could not watch me there the roots of those mountains must be roots indeed there must be great secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning so he journeyed by night up into the UNK and he found a little cave out of which the dark stream ran and he UNK his way like a maggot into the heart of the hills and vanished out of all knowledge the ring went into the shadows with him and even the maker when his power had begun to grow again could learn nothing of it gollum cried frodo gollum do you mean that this is the very UNK that bilbo met how UNK i think it is a sad story said the wizard and it might have happened to others even to some hobbits that i have known i cant believe that gollum was UNK with hobbits however UNK said frodo with some heat what an abominable notion it is true all the same replied gandalf about their UNK at any rate i know more than hobbits do themselves and even bilbos story UNK the UNK there was a great deal in the UNK of their minds and memories that was very similar they understood one another UNK well very much better than a hobbit would understand say a dwarf or an ore or even an elf think of the riddles they both knew for one thing yes said frodo though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles and of much the same sort and hobbits dont cheat gollum meant to cheat all the time he was just trying to put poor bilbo off his guard and i daresay it UNK his UNK to start a game which might end in UNK him with an easy UNK but if he lost would not hurt him only too true i fear said gandalf but there was something else in it i think which you dont see yet even gollum was not wholly ruined he had proved UNK than even one of the wise would have guessed UNK a hobbit might there was a little corner of his mind that was still his own and light came through it as through a UNK in the dark light out of the past it was actually pleasant i think to hear a kindly voice again bringing up memories of wind and trees and sun on the grass and such forgotten things but that of course would only make the evil part of him UNK in the end - unless it could be UNK unless it could be cured gandalf sighed alas there is little hope of that for him yet not no hope no not though he possessed the ring so long almost as far back as he can remember for it was long since he had worn it much in the black darkness it was seldom needed certainly he had never faded he is thin and tough still but the thing was eating up his mind of course and the torment had become almost UNK all the great secrets under the mountains had turned out to be just empty night there was nothing more to find out nothing worth doing only nasty UNK eating and UNK remembering he was altogether wretched he hated the dark and he hated light more he hated everything and the ring most of all what do you mean said frodo surely the ring was his precious and the only thing he UNK for but if he hated it why didnt he get rid of it or go away and leave it you ought to begin to understand frodo after all you have heard said gandalf he hated it and loved it as he hated and loved himself he could not get rid of it he had no will left in the matter a ring of power looks after itself frodo it may slip off UNK but its keeper never UNK it at most he UNK with the idea of UNK it on to someone UNK care - and that only at an early stage when it first begins to grip but as far as i know bilbo alone in history has ever gone beyond UNK and really done it he needed all my help too and even so he would never have just forsaken it or cast it aside it was not gollum frodo but the ring itself that decided things the ring left him  what just in time to meet bilbo said frodo wouldnt an ore have UNK it better it is no laughing matter said gandalf not for you it was the UNK event in the whole history of the ring so far bilbos arrival just at that time and putting his hand on it blindly in the dark there was more than one power at work frodo the ring was trying to get back to its master it had slipped from isildurs hand and betrayed him then when a chance came it caught poor deal and he was UNK and after that gollum and it had UNK him it could make no further use of him he was too small and mean and as long as it stayed with him he would never leave his deep pool again so now when its master was awake once more and UNK out his dark thought from mirkwood it UNK gollum only to be picked up by the most unlikely person UNK bilbo from the shire behind that there was something else at work beyond any UNK of the UNK i can put it no UNK than by saying that bilbo was meant to find the ring and not by its maker in which case you also were meant to have it and that maybe an encouraging thought it is not said frodo though i am not sure that i understand you but how have you learned all this about the ring and about gollum do you really know it all or are you just guessing still gandalf looked at frodo and his eyes glinted i knew much and i have learned much he answered but i am not going to give an account of all my doings to you the history of elendil and isildur and the one ring is known to all the wise your ring is shown to be that one ring by the UNK writing alone apart from any other evidence and when did you discover that asked frodo interrupting just now in this room of course answered the wizard sharply but i expected to find it i have come back from dark journeys and long search to make that final test it is the last UNK and all is now only too clear making out gollums part and UNK it into the gap in the history required some thought i may have started with guesses about gollum but i am not guessing now i know i have seen him you have seen gollum exclaimed frodo in amazement yes the UNK thing to do of course if one could i tried long ago but i have managed it at last then what happened after bilbo escaped from him do you know that not so clearly what i have told you is what gollum was willing to tell - though not of course in the way i have reported it gollum is a UNK and you have to UNK his words for instance he called the ring his birthday present and he stuck to that he said it came from his grandmother who had lots of beautiful things of that kind a ridiculous story i have no doubt that UNK grandmother was a UNK a great person in her way but to talk of her UNK many UNK was absurd and as for giving them away it was a lie but a lie with a UNK of truth the murder of deal UNK gollum and he had made up a defence UNK it to his precious over and over again as he UNK bones in the dark until he almost believed it it was his birthday deal ought to have given the ring to him it had UNK turned up just so as to be a present it was his birthday present and so on and on i endured him as long as i could but the truth was UNK important and in the end i had to be harsh i put the fear of fire on him and UNK the true story out of him bit by bit together with much UNK and UNK he thought he was UNK and UNK but when he had at last told me his history as far as the end of the UNK and bilbos escape he would not say any more except in dark hints some other fear was on him greater than mine he muttered that he was going to gel his own back people would see if he would stand being kicked and driven into a hole and then UNK gollum had good friends now good friends and very strong they would help him baggins would pay for it that was his chief thought he hated bilbo and cursed his name what is more he knew where he came from but how did he find that out asked frodo well as for the name bilbo very UNK told gollum himself and after that it would not be difficult to discover his country once gollum came out oh yes he came out his longing for the ring proved stronger than his fear of the ores or even of the light after a year or two he left the mountains you see though still bound by desire of it the ring was no longer UNK him he began to UNK a little he felt old terribly old yet less timid and he was UNK hungry light light of sun and moon he still feared and hated and he always will i think but he was cunning he found he could hide from daylight and UNK and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night with his pale cold eyes and catch small frightened or UNK things he grew stronger and UNK with new food and new air he found his way into mirkwood as one would expect is that where you found him asked frodo i saw him there answered gandalf but before that he had wandered far following bilbos trail it was difficult to learn anything from him for certain for his talk was constantly interrupted by UNK and UNK what had it got in its UNK he said it wouldnt say no precious little cheat not a fair question it UNK first it did it broke the rules we ought to have UNK it yes precious and we will precious that is a UNK of his talk i dont suppose you want any more i had weary days of it but from hints dropped among the UNK i even gathered that his UNK feet had taken him at last to UNK and even to the UNK of dale listening secretly and peering well the news of the great events went far and wide in wilderland and many had heard bilbos name and knew where he came from we had made no secret of our return journey to his home in the west gollums sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted then why didnt he track bilbo further asked frodo why didnt he come to the shire ah said gandalf now we come to it i think gollum tried to he set out and came back westward as far as the great river but then he turned aside he was not UNK by the distance i am sure no something else drew him away so my friends think those that hunted him for me the wood UNK UNK him first an easy task for them for his trail was still fresh then through mirkwood and back again it led them though they never caught him the wood was full of the rumour of him dreadful tales even among beasts and birds the UNK said that there was some new terror abroad a UNK that drank blood it climbed trees to find UNK it crept into holes to find the young it slipped through windows to find UNK but at the western edge of mirkwood the trail turned away it wandered off southwards and passed out of the UNK UNK and was lost and then i made a great mistake yes frodo and not the first though i fear it may prove the worst i let the matter be i let him go for i had much else to think of at that time and i still trusted the lore of saruman well that was years ago i have paid for it since with many dark and dangerous days the trail was long cold when i took it up again after bilbo left here and my search would have been in vain but for the help that i had from a friend aragorn the greatest traveller and UNK of this age of the world together we sought for gollum down the whole length of wilderland without hope and without UNK but at last when i had given up the UNK and turned to other parts gollum was found my friend returned out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with him what he had been doing he would not say he only wept and called us cruel with many a gollum in his throat and when we pressed him he whined and UNK and rubbed his long hands UNK his fingers as if they UNK him as if he remembered some old UNK but i am afraid there is no possible doubt he had made his slow UNK way step by step mile by mile south down at last to the land of mordor a heavy silence fell in the room frodo could hear his heart beating even outside everything seemed still no sound of sams shears could now be heard yes to mordor said gandalf alas mordor draws all wicked things and the dark power was bending all its will to gather them there the ring of the enemy would leave its mark too leave him open to the UNK and all folk were whispering then of the new shadow in the south and its hatred of the west there were his fine new friends who would help him in his revenge  wretched fool in that land he would learn much too much for his comfort and sooner or later as he UNK and UNK on the borders he would be caught and taken - for UNK that was the way of it i fear when he was found he had already been there long and was on his way back on some errand of mischief but that does not matter much now his worst mischief was done yes alas through him the enemy has learned that the one has been found again he knows where isildur fell he knows where gollum found his ring he knows that it is a great ring for it gave long life he knows that it is not one of the three for they have never been lost and they endure no evil he knows that it is not one of the seven or the nine for they are accounted for he knows that it is the one and he has at last heard i think of hobbits and the shire the shire - he may be seeking for it now if he has not already found out where it lies indeed frodo i fear that he may even think that the long UNK name of baggins has become important but this is terrible cried frodo far worse than the worst that i imagined from your hints and warnings o gandalf best of friends what am i to do for now i am really afraid what am i to do what a pity that bilbo did not UNK that UNK creature when he had a chance pity it was pity that stayed his hand pity and UNK not to strike without need and he has been well UNK frodo be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil and escaped in the end because he began his UNK of the ring so with pity i am sorry said frodo but i am frightened and i do not feel any pity for gollum you have not seen him gandalf broke in no and i dont want to said frodo i cant understand you do you mean to say that you and the elves have let him live on after all those horrible deeds now at any rate he is as bad as an ore and just an enemy he UNK death UNK it i daresay he does many that live deserve death and some that die deserve life can you give it to them then do not be too eager to deal out death in UNK for even the very wise cannot see all ends i have not much hope that gollum can be cured before he UNK but there is a chance of it and he is bound up with the fate of the ring my heart tells me that he has some part to play yet for good or ill before the end and when that comes the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many - yours not least in any case we did not kill him he is very old and very wretched the UNK have him in UNK but they UNK him with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts all the same said frodo even if bilbo could not kill gollum i wish he had not kept the ring i wish he had never found it and that i had not got it why did you let me keep it why didnt you make me throw it away or or destroy it let you make you said the wizard havent you been listening to all that i have said you are not thinking of what you are saying but as for throwing it away that was obviously wrong these rings have a way of being found in evil hands it might have done great evil worst of all it might have fallen into the hands of the enemy indeed it certainly would for this is the one and he is UNK all his power to find it or draw it to himself of course my dear frodo it was dangerous for you and that has troubled me deeply but there was so much at UNK that i had to take some risk - though even when i was far away there has never been a day when the shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes as long as you never used it i did not think that the ring would have any lasting effect on you not for evil not at any rate for a very long time and you must remember that nine years ago when i last saw you i still knew little for certain but why not destroy it as you say should have been done long ago cried frodo again if you had UNK me or even sent me a message i would have done away with it would you how would you do that have you ever tried no but i suppose one could hammer it or melt it try said gandalf try now frodo drew the ring out of his pocket again and looked at it it now appeared plain and smooth without mark or UNK that he could see the gold looked very fair and UNK and frodo thought how rich and beautiful was its colour how perfect was its UNK it was an UNK thing and altogether precious when he took it out he had intended to fling it from him into the very UNK part of the fire but he found now that he could not do so not without a great struggle he weighed the ring in his hand hesitating and UNK himself to remember all that gandalf had told him and then with an effort of will he made a movement as if to cast it away - but he found that he had put it back in his pocket gandalf laughed grimly you see already you too frodo cannot easily let it go nor will to UNK it and i could not make you - except by force which would break your mind but as for breaking the ring force is useless even if you took it and struck it with a heavy UNK it would make no UNK in it it cannot be UNK by your hands or by mine your small fire of course would not melt even ordinary gold this ring has already passed through it UNK and even UNK but there is no smiths UNK in this shire that could change it at all not even the UNK and UNK of the dwarves could do that it has been said that UNK could melt and UNK the rings of power but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough nor was there ever any dragon not even UNK the black who could have UNK the one ring the ruling ring for that was made by sauron himself there is only one way to find the cracks of doom in the depths of UNK the UNK and cast the ring in there if you really wish to destroy it to put it beyond the grasp of the enemy for ever i do really wish to destroy it cried frodo or well to have it destroyed i am not made for perilous UNK i wish i had never seen the ring  why did it come to me why was i chosen such questions cannot be answered said gandalf you may be sure that it was not for any UNK that others do not possess not for power or wisdom at any rate but you have been chosen and you must therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you have but i have so little of any of these things you are wise and powerful will you not take the ring no cried gandalf springing to his feet with that power i should have power too great and terrible and over me the ring would UNK a power still greater and more deadly his eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fire within do not UNK me for i do not wish to become like the dark lord himself yet the way of the ring to my heart is by pity pity for UNK and the desire of strength to do good do not UNK me i dare not take it not even to keep it safe UNK the wish to wield it would be too great for my strength i shall have such need of it great perils lie before me he went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters sunlight streamed back again into the room sam passed along the path outside whistling and now said the wizard turning back to frodo the decision lies with you but i will always help you he laid his hand on frodos shoulder i will help you bear this burden as long as it is yours to bear but we must do something soon the enemy is moving there was a long silence gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe as if lost in thought his eyes seemed closed but under the UNK he was watching frodo intently frodo gazed UNK at the red UNK on the hearth until they filled all his vision and he seemed to be looking down into UNK wells of fire he was thinking of the UNK cracks of doom and the terror of the fiery mountain well said gandalf at last what are you thinking about have you decided what to do no answered frodo coming back to himself out of darkness and finding to his surprise that it was not dark and that out of the window he could see the sunlit garden or perhaps yes as far as i understand what you have said i suppose i must keep the ring and guard it at least for the present whatever it may do to me whatever it may do it will be slow slow to evil if you keep it with that purpose said gandalf i hope so said frodo but i hope that you may find some other better keeper soon but in the meanwhile it seems that i am a danger a danger to all that live near me i cannot keep the ring and stay here i ought to leave bag end leave the shire leave everything and go away he sighed i should like to save the shire if i could - though there have been times when i thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words and have felt that an UNK or an UNK of dragons might be good for them but i dont feel like that now i feel that as long as the shire lies behind safe and comfortable i shall find wandering more UNK i shall know that somewhere there is a firm UNK even if my feet cannot stand there again of course i have sometimes thought of going away but i imagined that as a kind of holiday a UNK of adventures like bilbos or better ending in peace but this would mean exile a flight from danger into danger drawing it after me and i suppose i must go alone if i am to do that and save the shire but i feel very small and very UNK and well - desperate the enemy is so strong and terrible he did not tell gandalf but as he was speaking a great desire to follow bilbo UNK up in his heart - to follow bilbo and even perhaps to find him again it was so strong that it overcame his fear he could almost have run out there and then down the road without his hat as bilbo had done on a similar morning long ago my dear frodo exclaimed gandalf hobbits really are UNK creatures as i have said before you can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a UNK i hardly expected to get such an answer not even from you but bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir though he little thought how important it would prove i am afraid you are right the ring will not be able to stay hidden in the shire much longer and for your own sake as well as for others you will have to go and leave the name of baggins behind you that name will not be safe to have outside the shire or in the wild i will give you a UNK name now when you go go as mr underhill but i dont think you need go alone not if you know of anyone you can trust and who would be willing to go by your side - and that you would be willing to take into unknown perils but if you look for a companion be careful in choosing and be careful of what you say even to your UNK friends the enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing suddenly he stopped as if listening frodo became aware that all was very quiet inside and outside gandalf crept to one side of the window then with a UNK he sprang to the UNK and thrust a long arm out and downwards there was a UNK and up came sam UNK UNK head UNK by one ear well well bless my beard said gandalf sam gamgee is it now what may you be doing UNK bless you mr gandalf sir said sam nothing UNK i was just UNK the UNK under the window if you follow me he picked up his shears and UNK them as evidence i dont said gandalf grimly it is some time since i last heard the sound of your shears how long have you been UNK UNK sir i dont follow you begging your pardon there aint no eaves at bag end and thats a fact dont be a fool what have you heard and why did you listen gandalf s eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like UNK mr frodo sir cried sam quaking dont let him hurt me sir dont let him turn me into anything UNK my old UNK would take on so i meant no harm on my honour sir he wont hurt you said frodo hardly able to keep from laughing although he was himself startled and rather puzzled he knows as well as i do that you mean no harm but just you up and answer his questions straight away well sir said sam UNK a little i heard a deal that i didnt rightly understand about an enemy and rings and mr bilbo sir and dragons and a fiery mountain and - and elves sir i listened because i couldnt help myself if you know what i mean UNK bless me sir but i do love tales of that sort and i believe them too whatever ted may say elves sir i would dearly love to see them couldnt you take me to see elves sir when you go suddenly gandalf laughed come inside he shouted and putting out both his arms he lifted the astonished sam shears UNK and all right through the window and stood him on the floor take you to see elves eh he said UNK sam closely but with a smile UNK on his face so you heard that mr frodo is going away i did sir and thats why i choked which you heard UNK i tried not to sir but it burst out of me i was so UNK it cant be helped sam said frodo sadly he had suddenly realized that flying from the shire would mean more painful UNK than merely saying farewell to the familiar UNK of bag end i shall have to go but - and here he looked hard at sam - if you really care about me you will keep that dead secret see if you dont if you even breathe a word of what youve heard here then i hope gandalf will turn you into a UNK UNK and fill the garden full of UNK sam fell on his knees trembling get up sam said gandalf i have thought of something better than that something to shut your mouth and UNK you UNK for listening you shall go away with mr frodo me sir cried sam springing up like a dog invited for a walk me go and see elves and all UNK he shouted and then burst into tears chapter   three is company you ought to go quietly and you ought to go soon said gandalf two or three weeks had passed and still frodo made no sign of getting ready to UNK i know but it is difficult to do both he UNK if i just vanish like bilbo the tale will be all over the shire in no time of course you UNK vanish said gandalf that wouldnt do at all i said soon not UNK if you can think of any way of slipping out of the shire without its being generally known it will be worth a little delay but you must not delay too long what about the autumn on or after our birthday asked frodo i think i could probably make some UNK by then to tell the truth he was very reluctant to start now that it had come to the point bag end seemed a more UNK UNK than it had for years and he wanted to UNK as much as he could of his last summer in the shire when autumn came he knew that part at least of his heart would think more kindly of journeying as it always did at that UNK he had indeed UNK made up his mind to leave on his fiftieth birthday bilbos one hundred and UNK it seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and follow him following bilbo was UNK in his mind and the one thing that made the thought of leaving UNK he thought as little as possible about the ring and where it might lead him in the end but he did not tell all his thoughts to gandalf what the wizard guessed was always difficult to tell he looked at frodo and smiled very well he said i think that will do - but it must not be any later i am getting very anxious in the UNK do take care and dont let out any hint of where you are going and see that sam gamgee does not talk if he does i really shall turn him into a UNK as for where i am going said frodo it would be difficult to give that away for i have no clear idea myself yet dont be absurd said gandalf i am not warning you against leaving an UNK at the UNK but you are leaving the shire - and that should not be known until you are far away and you must go or at least set out either north south west or east - and the direction should certainly not be known i have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving bag end and of saying farewell that i have never even considered the direction said frodo for where am i to go and by what shall i UNK what is to be my quest bilbo went to find a treasure there and back again but i go to lose one and not return as far as i can see but you cannot see very far said gandalf neither can i it may be your task to find the cracks of doom but that quest may be for others i do not know at any rate you are not ready for that long road yet no indeed said frodo but in the meantime what course am i to lake towards danger but not too UNK nor too straight answered the wizard if you want my advice make for rivendell that journey should not prove too perilous though the road is less easy than it was and it will grow worse as the year fails rivendell said frodo very good i will go east and i will make for rivendell i will take sam to visit the elves he will be delighted he spoke lightly but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the house of elrond UNK and breathe the air of that deep valley where many of the fair folk still dwelt in peace one summers evening an astonishing piece of news reached the UNK UNK and green dragon giants and other UNK on the borders of the shire were forgotten for more important matters mr frodo was selling bag end indeed he had already sold it - to the sackville-bagginses for a nice bit UNK said some at a UNK price said others and thats more likely when UNK UNK the UNK otho had died some years before at the ripe but UNK age of  just why mr frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more UNK than the price a few held the UNK - UNK by the UNK and hints of mr baggins himself - that frodos money was running out he was going to leave hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the UNK of the sale down in buckland among his brandybuck relations as far from the sackville-bagginses as may be some added but so firmly fixed had the notion of the UNK wealth of the bagginses of bag end become that most found this hard to believe harder than any other reason or UNK that their fancy could UNK to most it suggested a dark and yet UNK plot by gandalf though he kept himself very quiet and did not go about by day it was well known that he was hiding up in the bag end but however a UNK might fit in with the designs of his UNK there was no doubt about the fact frodo baggins was going back to buckland yes i shall be moving this autumn he said merry brandybuck is looking out for a nice little hole for me or perhaps a small house as a matter of fact with merrys help he had already chosen and UNK a little house at crickhollow in the country beyond bucklebury to all but sam he UNK he was going to settle down there UNK the decision to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him for buckland was on the eastern borders of the shire and as he had lived there in UNK his going back would at least seem UNK gandalf stayed in the shire for over two months then one evening at the end of june soon after frodos plan had been finally UNK he suddenly UNK that he was going off again next morning only for a short while i hope he said but i am going down beyond the southern borders to get some news if i can i have been idle longer than i should he spoke lightly but it seemed to frodo that he looked rather worried has anything happened he asked well no but i have heard something that has made me anxious and needs looking into if i think it necessary after all for you to get off at once i shall come back immediately or at least send word in the meanwhile stick to your plan but be more careful than ever especially of the ring UNK me UNK on you once more dont use it he went off at dawn i may be back any day he said at the very latest i shall come back for the farewell party i think after all you may need my company on the road at first frodo was a good deal disturbed and wondered often what gandalf could have heard but his UNK wore off and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while the shire had seldom seen so fair a summer or so rich an autumn the trees were laden with apples UNK was dripping in the UNK and the UNK was tall and full autumn was well under way before frodo began to worry about gandalf again september was passing and there was still no news of him the birthday and the UNK drew nearer and still he did not come or send word bag end began to be busy some of frodos friends came to stay and help him with the packing there was fredegar bolger and UNK boffin and of course his special friends pippin took and merry brandybuck between them they turned the whole place UNK on september UNK two covered carts went off laden to buckland UNK the UNK and goods that frodo had not sold to his new home by way of the brandywine bridge the next day frodo became really anxious and kept a UNK UNK for gandalf UNK his birthday morning dawned as fair and clear as it had long ago for bilbos great party still gandalf did not appear in the evening frodo gave his farewell feast it was quite small just a dinner for himself and his four UNK but he was troubled and fell in no mood for it the thought that he would so soon have to part with his young friends weighed on his heart he wondered how he would break it to them the four younger hobbits were however in high spirits and the party soon became very cheerful in spite of gandalf s UNK the UNK was bare except for a table and chairs but the food was good and there was good wine frodos wine had not been included in the sale to the sackville-bagginses whatever UNK to the rest of my stuff when the s-bs get their UNK on it at any rate i have found a good home for this said frodo as he drained his glass it was the last drop of old UNK when they had sung many songs and talked of many things they had done together they UNK bilbos birthday and they drank his health and frodos together according to frodos custom then they went out for a sniff of air and glimpse of the stars and then they went to bed frodos party was over and gandalf had not come the next morning they were busy packing another UNK with the remainder of the luggage merry took UNK of this and drove off with fatty that is fredegar bolger someone must get there and warm the house before you UNK said merry well see you later - the day after tomorrow if you dont go to sleep on the way UNK went home after lunch but pippin remained behind frodo was restless and anxious listening in vain for a sound of gandalf he decided to wait until nightfall after that if gandalf wanted him urgently he would go to crickhollow and might even get there first for frodo was going on foot his plan - for UNK and a last look at the shire as much as any other reason - was to walk from hobbiton to bucklebury ferry taking it fairly easy i shall get myself a bit into UNK too he said looking at himself in a UNK mirror in the UNK hall he had not done any UNK walking for a long time and the UNK looked rather UNK he thought after lunch the sackville-bagginses lobelia and her UNK son UNK turned up much to frodos UNK ours at last said lobelia as she stepped inside it was not polite nor UNK true for the sale of bag end did not take effect until midnight but lobelia can perhaps be UNK she had been obliged to wait about UNK years longer for bag end than she once hoped and she was now a hundred years old anyway she had come to see that nothing she had paid for had been carried off and she wanted the UNK it took a long while to UNK her as she had brought a complete UNK with her and went right through it in the end she departed with UNK and the spare key and the promise that the other key would be left at the UNK in bagshot row she snorted and showed plainly that she thought the UNK UNK of UNK the hole during the night frodo did not offer her any tea he took his own tea with pippin and sam gamgee in the kitchen it had been UNK UNK that sam was coming to buckland to do for mr frodo and look after his bit of garden an UNK that was approved by the gaffer though it did not UNK him for the prospect of having lobelia as a UNK our last meal at bag end said frodo pushing back his chair they left the UNK up for lobelia pippin and sam UNK up their three packs and piled them in the porch pippin went out for a last UNK in the garden sam disappeared the sun went down bag end seemed sad and gloomy and UNK frodo wandered round the familiar rooms and saw the light of the sunset fade on the walls and shadows creep out of the corners it grew slowly dark indoors he went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path and then on a short way down the hill road he half expected to see gandalf come UNK up through the dusk the sky was clear and the stars were growing bright its going to be a fine night he said aloud thats good for a beginning i feel like walking i cant bear any more hanging about i am going to start and gandalf must follow me he turned to go back and then slopped for he heard voices just round the corner by the end of bagshot row one voice was certainly the old gaffers the other was strange and somehow unpleasant he could not make out what it said but he heard the gaffers UNK which were rather shrill the old man seemed put out no mr baggins has gone away went this morning and my sam went with him anyway all his stuff went yes sold out and gone i UNK why UNK none of my business or yours where to that aint no secret hes moved to bucklebury or some such place away down yonder yes it is - a UNK way ive never been so far myself theyre queer folks in buckland no i cant give no message good night to you footsteps went away down the hill frodo wondered UNK why the fact that they did not come on up the hill seemed a great relief i am UNK of questions and curiosity about my doings i suppose he thought what an inquisitive lot they all are he had half a mind to go and ask the gaffer who the UNK was but he thought better or worse of it and turned and walked quickly back to bag end pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch sam was not there frodo stepped inside the dark door sam he called sam time coming sir came the answer from far within followed soon by sam himself UNK his mouth he had been saying farewell to the beer UNK in the UNK all UNK sam said frodo yes sir ill last for a bit now sir frodo shut and locked the round door and gave the key to sam run down with this to your home sam he said then cut along the row and meet us as quick as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows we are not going through the village tonight too many ears UNK and eyes UNK sam ran off at full speed well now were off at last said frodo they UNK their packs and took up their sticks and walked round the corner to the west side of bag end good-bye said frodo looking at the dark blank windows he waved his hand and then turned and following bilbo if he had known it hurried after peregrin down the UNK they jumped over the low place in the hedge at the bottom and took to the fields passing into the darkness like a rustle in the grasses at the bottom of the hill on its western side they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane there they halted and UNK the UNK of their packs presently sam appeared trotting quickly and breathing hard his heavy pack was UNK high on his shoulders and he had put on his head a tall shapeless fell bag which he called a hat in the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf i am sure you have given me all the UNK stuff said frodo i pity UNK and all that carry their UNK on their backs i could take a lot more yet sir my UNK is quite light said sam UNK and UNK no you dont sam said pippin it is good for him hes got nothing except what he ordered us to pack hes been UNK lately and hell feel the weight less when hes walked off some of his own be kind to a poor old hobbit laughed frodo i shall be as thin as a UNK im sure before i get to buckland but i was talking nonsense i suspect you have taken more than your share sam and i shall look into it at our next packing he picked up his stick again well we all like walking in the dark he said so lets put some miles behind us before bed for a short way they followed the lane westwards then leaving it they turned left and took quietly to the fields again they went in single file along UNK and the borders of UNK and night fell dark about them in their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic rings since they were all hobbits and were trying to be silent they made no noise that even hobbits would hear even the wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed their passing after some time they crossed the water west of hobbiton by a narrow UNK UNK the stream was there no more than a winding black UNK UNK with leaning UNK -trees a mile or two further south they hastily crossed the great road from the brandywine bridge they were now in the UNK and bending UNK they made for the green hill country as they began to climb its first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps in hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the water soon it disappeared in the UNK of the darkened land and was followed by by water beside its grey pool when the light of the last farm was far behind peeping among the trees frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell i wonder if i shall ever look down into that valley again he said quietly when they had walked for about three hours they rested the night was clear cool and starry but UNK wisps of mist were creeping up the UNK from the streams and deep meadows UNK UNK UNK in a light wind above their heads made a black UNK against the pale sky they ate a very UNK supper for hobbits and then went on again soon they struck a narrow road that went rolling up and down fading grey into the darkness ahead the road to woodhall and stock and the bucklebury ferry it climbed away from the main road in the water -valley and wound over the skirts of the green hills towards UNK a wild corner of the eastfarthing after a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night it was very dark at first they talked or UNK a tune softly together being now far away from inquisitive ears then they marched on in silence and pippin began to UNK behind at last as they began to climb a steep slope he stopped and yawned i am so sleepy he said that soon i shall fall down on the road are you going to sleep on your legs it is nearly midnight i thought you liked walking in the dark said frodo but there is no great hurry merry UNK us some time the day after tomorrow but that leaves us nearly two days more well halt at the first likely spot the winds in the west said sam if we get to the other side of this hill we shall find a spot that is sheltered and UNK enough sir there is a dry UNK just ahead if i remember rightly sam knew the land well within twenty miles of hobbiton but that was the UNK of his UNK just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of UNK leaving the road they went into the deep UNK darkness of the trees and gathered dead sticks and UNK to make a fire soon they had a merry UNK of flame at the foot of a large UNK and they sat round it for a while until they began to UNK then each in an UNK of the great trees roots they curled up in their cloaks and blankets and were soon fast asleep they set no watch even frodo feared no danger yet for they were still in the heart of the shire a few creatures came and looked at them when the fire had died away a UNK passing through the wood on business of his own stopped several minutes and UNK hobbits he thought well what next i have heard of strange doings in this land but i have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors under a tree three of them theres something mighty queer behind this he was quite right but he never found out any more about it the morning came pale and UNK frodo woke up first and found that a UNK had made a hole in his back and that his neck was stiff walking for UNK why didnt i drive he thought as he usually did at the beginning of an UNK and all my beautiful feather beds are sold to the sackville-bagginses these UNK would do them good he stretched wake up hobbits he cried its a beautiful morning whats beautiful about it said pippin peering over the edge of his blanket with one eye sam gel breakfast ready for UNK nine have you got the UNK hot sam jumped up looking rather UNK no sir i havent sir he said frodo UNK the blankets from pippin and rolled him over and then walked off to the edge of the wood away eastward the sun was rising red out of the mists that lay thick on the world touched with gold and red the autumn trees seemed to be sailing UNK in a shadowy sea a little below him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared when he returned sam and pippin had got a good fire going water shouted pippin wheres the water i dont keep water in my UNK said frodo we thought you had gone to find some said pippin busy setting out the food and UNK you had better go now you can come too said frodo and bring all the UNK there was a stream at the foot of the hill they filled their bottles and the small UNK UNK at a little fall where the water fell a few feet over an UNK of grey stone it was icy cold and they UNK and puffed as they UNK their faces and hands when their breakfast was over and their packs all UNK up again it was after ten oclock and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot they went down the slope and across the stream where it dived under the road and up the next slope and up and down another shoulder of the hills and by that time their cloaks blankets water food and other gear already seemed a heavy burden the days march promised to be warm and tiring work after some miles however the road ceased to roll up and down it climbed to the top of a steep bank in a weary UNK sort of way and then prepared to go down for the last time in front of them they saw the lower lands UNK with small UNK of trees that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland haze they were looking across the UNK end towards the brandywine river the road wound away before them like a piece of string the road goes on for ever said pippin but i cant without a rest it is high time for lunch he sat down on the bank at the side of the road and looked away east into the haze beyond which lay the river and the end of the shire in which he had spent all his life sam stood by him his round eyes were wide open - for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a new UNK do elves live in those woods he asked not that i ever heard said pippin frodo was silent he too was gazing eastward along the road as if he had never seen it before suddenly he spoke aloud but as if to himself saying slowly the road goes ever on and on down from the door where it began now far ahead the road has gone and i must follow if i can pursuing it with weary feet until it UNK some larger way where many paths and UNK meet and whither then i cannot say that sounds like a bit of old bilbos UNK said pippin or is it one of your UNK it does not sound altogether encouraging i dont know said frodo it came to me then as if i was making it up but i may have heard it long ago certainly it UNK me very much of bilbo in the last years before he went away he used often to say there was only one road that it was like a great river its springs were at every doorstep and every path was its UNK its a dangerous business frodo going out of your door he used to say you step into the road and if you dont keep your feet there is no knowing where you might be swept off to do you UNK that this is the very path that goes through mirkwood and that if you let it it might take you to the lonely mountain or even further and to worse places he used to say that on the path outside the front door at bag end especially after he had been out for a long walk well the road wont sweep me anywhere for an hour at least said pippin UNK his pack the others followed his UNK putting their packs against the bank and their legs out into the road after a rest they had a good lunch and then more rest the sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the land as they went down the hill so far they had not met a UNK on the road this way was not much used being hardly fit for carts and there was little traffic to the UNK end they had been jogging along again for an hour or more when sam stopped a moment as if listening they were now on level ground and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through UNK UNK with tall trees UNK of the approaching woods i can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind said sam they looked back but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far i wonder if that is gandalf coming after us said frodo but even as he said it he had a feeling that it was not so and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him it may not matter much he said UNK but i would rather not be seen on the road - by anyone i am UNK of my doings being noticed and discussed and if it is gandalf he added as an UNK we can give him a little surprise to pay him out for being so late lets get out of sight the other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not far from the road there they lay flat frodo hesitated for a second curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire to hide the sound of hoofs drew nearer just in time he threw himself down in a patch of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road then he lifted his head and peered cautiously above one of the great roots round the corner came a black horse no UNK but a UNK horse and on it sat a large man who seemed to UNK in the saddle wrapped in a great black cloak and hood so that only his boots in the high UNK showed below his face was UNK and invisible when it reached the tree and was level with frodo the horse stopped the riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed as if listening from inside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an UNK scent the head turned from side to side of the road a sudden UNK fear of discovery laid hold of frodo and he thought of his ring he hardly dared to breathe and yet the desire to get it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand he felt that he had only to slip it on and then he would be safe the advice of gandalf seemed absurd bilbo had used the ring and i am still in the shire he thought as his hand touched the chain on which it hung at that moment the rider sat up and shook the UNK the horse stepped forward walking slowly at first and then breaking into a quick UNK frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider until he dwindled into the distance he could not be quite sure but it seemed to him that suddenly before it passed out of sight the horse turned aside and went into the trees on the right well i call that very queer and indeed UNK said frodo to himself as he walked towards his companions pippin and sam had remained flat in the grass and had seen nothing so frodo UNK the rider and his strange UNK i cant say why but i felt certain he was looking or smelling for me and also i felt certain that i did not want him to discover me ive never seen or fell anything like it in the shire before but what has one of the big people got to do with us said pippin and what is he doing in this part of the world there are some men about said frodo down in the southfarthing they have had trouble with big people i believe but i have never heard of anything like this rider i wonder where he comes from begging your pardon put in sam suddenly i know where he comes from its from hobbiton that this here black rider comes unless theres more than one and i know where hes going to what do you mean said frodo sharply looking at him in astonishment why didnt you speak up before i have only just remembered sir it was like this when i got back to our hole yesterday evening with the key my UNK he says to me UNK sam he says i thought you were away with mr frodo this morning theres been a strange UNK asking for mr baggins of bag end and hes only just gone ive sent him on to bucklebury not that UNK the sound of him he seemed mighty put out when i told him mr baggins had left his old home for good hissed at me he did it gave me quite a UNK what sort of a fellow was he says i to the gaffer  don t know says he but he UNK t a hobbit he was tall and UNK and he stooped UNK me i reckon it was one of the big folk from UNK parts he spoke funny i couldnt stay to hear more sir since you were waiting and i didnt give much heed to it myself the gaffer is getting old and more than a bit blind and it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the hill and found him taking the air at the end of our row i hope he hasnt done no harm sir nor me the gaffer cant be UNK anyway said frodo as a matter of fact i heard him talking to a stranger who seemed to be UNK for me and i nearly went and asked him who it was i wish i had or you had told me about it before i might have been more careful on the road still there may be no UNK between this rider and the gaffers stranger said pippin we left hobbiton secretly enough and i dont see how he could have followed us what about the smelling sir said sam and the gaffer said he was a black UNK i wish i had waited for gandalf frodo muttered but perhaps it would only have made matters worse then you know or guess something about this rider said pippin who had caught the muttered words i dont know and i would rather not guess said frodo all right cousin frodo you can keep your secret for the present if you want to be mysterious in the meanwhile what are we to do i should like a bite and a UNK but somehow i think we had better move on from here your talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has UNK me yes i think we will move on now said frodo but not on the road UNK case that rider comes back or another UNK him we ought to do a good step more today buckland is still miles away the shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass as they started off again they now kept a stones throw to the left of the road and kept out of sight of it as much as they could but this hindered them for the grass was thick and UNK and the ground UNK and the trees began to draw together into thickets the sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs and evening was coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level over which it had run straight for some miles at that point it bent left and went down into the UNK of the UNK making for stock but a lane UNK right winding through a wood of ancient UNK on its way to woodhall that is the way for us said frodo not far from the UNK they came on the huge UNK of a tree it was still alive and had leaves on the small branches that it had put out round the broken UNK of its UNK limbs but it was hollow and could be entered by a great crack on the side away from the road the hobbits crept inside and sat there upon a floor of old leaves and UNK wood they rested and had a light meal talking quietly and listening from time to time twilight was about them as they crept back to the lane the west wind was sighing in the branches leaves were whispering soon the road began to fall gently but steadily into the dusk a star came out above the trees in the UNK east before them they went UNK and in step to keep up their spirits after a time as the stars grew thicker and brighter the feeling of UNK left them and they no longer listened for the sound of hoofs they began to UNK softly as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk along especially when they are drawing near to home at night with most hobbits it is a UNK or a UNK but these hobbits UNK a UNK though not of course without any mention of supper and bed bilbo baggins had made the words to a tune that was as old as the hills and taught it to frodo as they walked in the UNK of the water -valley and talked about adventure upon the hearth the fire is red beneath the roof there is a bed but not yet weary are our feet still round the corner we may meet a sudden tree or standing stone that none have seen but we alone tree and flower and leaf and grass let them pass let them pass hill and water under sky pass them by pass them by still round the corner there may wait a new road or a secret gate and though we pass them by today tomorrow we may come this way and take the hidden paths that run towards the moon or to the sun apple UNK and UNK and UNK let them go let them go UNK and stone and pool and dell fare you well fare you well home is behind the world ahead and there are many paths to tread through shadows to the edge of night until the stars are all UNK then world behind and home ahead well wander back to home and bed mist and twilight cloud and shade away shall fade away shall fade fire and lamp and UNK and bread and then to bed and then to bed the song ended and now to bed and now to bed sang pippin in a high voice hush said frodo i think i hear hoofs again they slopped suddenly and stood as silent as UNK listening there was a sound of hoofs in the lane some way behind but coming slow and clear down the wind quickly and quietly they slipped off the path and ran into the deeper shade under the UNK dont let us go too far said frodo i dont want to be seen but i want to see if it is another black rider very well said pippin but dont forget the sniffing the hoofs drew nearer they had no time to find any UNK better than the general darkness under the trees sam and pippin crouched behind a large UNK while frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane it showed grey and pale a line of fading light through the wood above it the stars were thick in the dim sky but there was no moon the sound of hoofs stopped as frodo watched he saw something dark pass across the lighter space between two trees and then halt it looked like the black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadow the black shadow stood close to the point where they had left the path and it swayed from side to side frodo thought he heard the sound of UNK the shadow bent to the ground and then began to UNK towards him once more the desire to slip on the ring came over frodo but this time it was stronger than before so strong that almost before he realized what he was doing his hand was groping in his pocket but at that moment there came a sound like mingled song and laughter clear voices rose and fell in the UNK air the black shadow UNK up and retreated it climbed on to the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side frodo breathed again elves exclaimed sam in a hoarse whisper elves sir he would have burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices if they had not pulled him back yes it is elves said frodo one can meet them sometimes in the UNK end they dont live in the shire but they wander into it in spring and autumn out of their own lands away beyond the tower hills i am UNK that they do you did not see but that black rider stopped just here and was actually crawling towards us when the song began as soon as he heard the voices he slipped away what about the elves said sam too UNK to trouble about the rider cant we go and see them listen they are coming this way said frodo we have only to wait the singing drew nearer one clear voice rose now above the others it was singing in the fair elven-tongue of which frodo knew only a little and the others knew nothing yet the sound UNK with the UNK seemed to shape itself in their thought into words which they only partly understood this was the song as frodo heard it snow-white snow-white o lady clear o queen beyond the western seas o light to us that wander here amid the world of woven trees gilthoniel o elbereth clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath snow-white snow-white we sing to thee in a far land beyond the sea o stars that in the UNK year with shining hand by her were UNK in UNK fields now bright and clear we see your silver UNK blown o elbereth gilthoniel we still remember we who dwell in this far land beneath the trees thy starlight on the western seas the song ended these are high elves they spoke the name of elbereth said frodo in amazement few of that fairest folk are ever seen in the shire not many now remain in middle-earth east of the great sea this is indeed a strange chance the hobbits sat in shadow by the UNK before long the elves came down the lane towards the valley they passed slowly and the hobbits could see the starlight glimmering on their hair and in their eyes they bore no lights yet as they walked a UNK like the light of the moon above the rim of the hills before it rises seemed to fall about their feet they were now silent and as the last elf passed he turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughed UNK frodo he cried you are abroad late or are you perhaps lost then he called aloud to the others and all the company stopped and gathered round this is indeed wonderful they said three hobbits in a wood at night we have not seen such a thing since bilbo went away what is the meaning of it the meaning of it fair people said frodo is simply that we seem to be going the same way as you are i like walking under the stars but i would welcome your company but we have no need of other company and hobbits are so dull they laughed and how do you know that we go the same way as you for you do not know whither we are going and how do you know my name asked frodo in return we know many things they said we have seen you often before with bilbo though you may not have seen us who are you and who is your lord asked frodo i am gildor answered their leader the elf who had first UNK him gildor UNK of the house of UNK we are UNK and most of our kindred have long ago departed and we too are now only UNK here a while ere we return over the great sea but some of our UNK dwell still in peace in rivendell come now frodo tell us what you are doing for we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you o wise people interrupted pippin eagerly tell us about the black riders black riders they said in low voices why do you ask about black riders because two black riders have UNK us today or one has done so twice said pippin only a little while ago he slipped away as you drew near the elves did not answer at once but spoke together softly in their own tongue at length gildor turned to the hobbits we will not speak of this here he said we think you had best come now with us it is not our custom but for this time we will lake you on our road and you shall UNK with us tonight if you will o fair folk this is good fortune beyond my hope said pippin sam was UNK i thank you indeed gildor UNK said frodo bowing UNK UNK UNK UNK a star UNK on the hour of our meeting he added in the UNK speech be careful friends cried gildor laughing speak no secrets here is a UNK in the ancient tongue bilbo was a good master UNK elf-friend he said bowing to frodo come now with your friends and join our company you had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray you may be weary before we halt why where are you going asked frodo for tonight we go to the woods on the hills above woodhall it is some miles but you shall have rest at the end of it and it will UNK your journey tomorrow they now marched on again in silence and passed like shadows and faint lights for elves even more than hobbits could walk when they wished without sound or UNK pippin soon began to feel sleepy and staggered once or twice but each time a tall elf at his side put out his arm and saved him from a fall sam walked along at frodos side as if in a dream with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished joy the woods on either side became UNK the trees were now younger and thicker and as the lane went lower running down into a fold of the hills there were many deep UNK of UNK on the rising slopes at either hand at last the elves turned aside from the path a green ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on the right and this they followed as it wound away back up the wooded slopes on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the lower land of the river -valley suddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees and before them lay a wide space of grass grey under the night on three sides the woods pressed upon it but eastward the ground fell steeply and the UNK of the dark trees growing at the bottom of the slope were below their feet beyond the low lands lay dim and flat under the stars nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of woodhall the elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices they seemed to take no further notice of the hobbits frodo and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets and UNK stole over them the night grew on and the lights in the valley went out pippin fell asleep UNK on a green UNK away high in the east swung UNK the UNK stars and slowly above the mists red UNK rose glowing like a jewel of fire then by some shift of UNK all the mist was drawn away like a veil and there leaned up as he climbed over the rim of the world the UNK of the sky UNK with his shining belt the elves all burst into song suddenly under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light come the elves called to the hobbits come now is the time for speech and UNK pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes he shivered there is a fire in the hall and food for hungry guests said an elf standing before him at the south end of the UNK there was an opening there the green floor ran on into the wood and formed a wide space like a hall UNK by the boughs of trees their great trunks ran like pillars down each side in the middle there was a UNK blazing and upon the UNK UNK with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily the elves sat round the fire upon the grass or upon the UNK rings of old trunks some went to and fro bearing UNK and pouring drink others brought food on UNK UNK and UNK this is poor fare they said to the hobbits for we are UNK in the UNK far from our halls if ever you are our guests at home we will UNK you better it seems to me good enough for a UNK said frodo pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink for his mind was filled with the light upon the UNK and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream but he remembered that there was bread UNK the UNK of a fair white UNK to one who is UNK and UNK sweet as UNK and UNK than the tended UNK of gardens he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught cool as a clear fountain golden as a summer afternoon sam could never UNK in words nor UNK clearly to himself what he felt or thought that night though it remained in his memory as one of the chief events of his life the nearest he ever got was to say well sir if i could grow apples like that i would call myself a UNK but it was the singing that went to my heart if you know what i mean frodo sat eating drinking and talking with delight but his mind was chiefly on the words spoken he knew a little of the UNK and listened eagerly now and again he spoke to those that served him and UNK them in their own language they smiled at him and said laughing here is a jewel among hobbits after a while pippin fell fast asleep and was lifted up and borne away to a UNK under the trees there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the rest of the night away sam refused to leave his master when pippin had gone he came and sat curled up at frodos feet where at last he nodded and closed his eyes frodo remained long awake talking with gildor they spoke of many things old and new and frodo questioned gildor much about UNK in the wide world outside the shire the tidings were mostly sad and ominous of gathering darkness the wars of men and the flight of the elves at last frodo asked the question that was nearest to his heart tell me gildor have you ever seen bilbo since he left us gildor smiled yes he answered twice he said farewell to us on this very spot but i saw him once again far from here he would say no more about bilbo and frodo fell silent you do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself frodo said gildor but i already know a little and i can read more in your face and in the thought behind your questions you are leaving the shire and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek or UNK what you UNK or that you will ever return is not that so it is said frodo but i thought my going was a secret known only to gandalf and my faithful sam he looked down at sam who was UNK gently the secret will not reach the enemy from us said gildor the enemy said frodo then you know why i am leaving the shire i do not know for what reason the enemy is pursuing you answered gildor but i perceive that he is - strange indeed though that seems to me and i warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you and upon either side you mean the riders i feared that they were servants of the enemy what are the black riders has gandalf told you nothing nothing about such creatures then i think it is not for me to say more - lest terror should keep you from your journey for it seems to me that you have set out only just in time if indeed you are in time you must now make haste and neither stay nor turn back for the shire is no longer any protection to you i cannot imagine what information could be more UNK than your hints and warnings exclaimed frodo i knew that danger lay ahead of course but i did not expect to meet it in our own shire cant a hobbit walk from the water to the river in peace but it is not your own shire said gildor others dwelt here before hobbits were and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more the wide world is all about you you can UNK yourselves in but you cannot for ever UNK it out i know - and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar what can i do now my plan was to leave the shire secretly and make my way to rivendell but now my footsteps are UNK before ever i get to buckland i think you should still follow that plan said gildor i do not think the road will prove too hard for your courage but if you desire clearer counsel you should ask gandalf i do not know the reason for your flight and therefore i do not know by what means your pursuers will UNK you these things gandalf must know i suppose that you will see him before you leave the shire i hope so but that is another thing that makes me anxious i have been expecting gandalf for many days he was to have come to hobbiton at the latest two nights ago but he has never appeared now i am wondering what can have happened should i wait for him gildor was silent for a moment i do not like this news he said at last that gandalf should be late does not UNK well but it is said do not UNK in the affairs of wizards for they are UNK and quick to anger the choice is yours to go or wait and it is also said answered frodo go not to the elves for counsel for they will say both no and yes  is it indeed laughed gildor elves seldom give UNK advice for advice is a dangerous gift even from the wise to the wise and all courses may run ill but what would you you have not told me all concerning yourself and how then shall i choose better than you but if you demand advice i will for UNK sake give it i think you should now go at once without delay and if gandalf does not come before you set out then i also advise this do not go alone take such friends as are UNK and willing now you should be grateful for i do not give this counsel gladly the elves have their own labours and their own UNK and they are little concerned with the ways of hobbits or of any other creatures upon earth our paths cross UNK seldom by chance or purpose in this meeting there may be more than chance but the purpose is not clear to me and i fear to say too much i am deeply grateful said frodo but i wish you would tell me plainly what the black riders are if i take your advice i may not see gandalf for a long while and i ought to know what is the danger that UNK me is it not enough to know that they are servants of the enemy answered gildor UNK them speak no words to them they are deadly ask no more of me but my heart UNK that ere all is ended you frodo son of drogo will know more of these fell things than gildor UNK may elbereth UNK you but where shall i find courage asked frodo that is what i chiefly need courage is found in unlikely places said gildor be of good hope sleep now in the morning we shall have gone but we will send our messages through the lands the wandering UNK shall know of your journey and those that have power for good shall be on the watch i name you elf-friend and may the stars shine upon the end of your road seldom have we had such delight in strangers and it is fair to hear words of the ancient speech from the lips of other wanderers in the world frodo felt sleep coming upon him even as gildor finished speaking i will sleep now he said and the elf led him to a UNK beside pippin and he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a UNK UNK chapter   a short cut to mushrooms in the morning frodo woke refreshed he was lying in a UNK made by a living tree with branches UNK and UNK to the ground his bed was of UNK and grass deep and soft and strangely fragrant the sun was shining through the fluttering leaves which were still green upon the tree he jumped up and went out sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood pippin was standing UNK the sky and weather there was no sign of the elves they have left us UNK and drink and bread said pippin come and have your breakfast the bread UNK almost as good as it did last night i did not want to leave you any but sam insisted frodo sat down beside sam and began to eat what is the plan for today asked pippin to walk to bucklebury as quickly as possible answered frodo and gave his attention to the food do you think we shall see anything of those riders asked pippin UNK under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole UNK of them did not seem very UNK to him yes probably said frodo not liking the UNK but i hope to get across the river without their seeing us did you find out anything about them from gildor not much - only hints and riddles said frodo UNK did you ask about the sniffing we didnt UNK it said frodo with his mouth full you should have i am sure it is very important in that case i am sure gildor would have refused to explain it said frodo sharply and now leave me in peace for a bit i dont want to answer a string of questions while i am eating i want to think good heavens said pippin at breakfast he walked away towards the edge of the green from frodo s mind the bright morning - UNK bright he thought - had not UNK the fear of pursuit and he pondered the words of gildor the merry voice of pippin came to him he was running on the green turf and singing no i could not he said to himself it is one thing to take my young friends walking over the shire with me until we are hungry and weary and food and bed are sweet to take them into exile where hunger and weariness may have no cure is quite another - even if they are willing to come the UNK is mine alone i dont think i ought even to take sam he looked at sam gamgee and discovered that sam was watching him well sam he said what about it i am leaving the shire as soon as ever i can - in fact i have made up my mind now not even to wait a day at crickhollow if it can be helped very good sir you still mean to come with me i do it is going to be very dangerous sam it is already dangerous most likely neither of us will come back if you dont come back sir then i shant thats certain said sam dont you leave him they said to me leave him i said i never mean to i am going with him if he UNK to the moon and if any of those black UNK try to stop him theyll have sam gamgee to reckon with i said they laughed who are they and what are you talking about the elves sir we had some talk last night and they seemed to know you were going away so i didnt see the use of UNK it wonderful folk elves sir wonderful they are said frodo do you like them still now you have had a closer view they seem a bit above my likes and UNK so to speak answered sam slowly it dont seem to matter what i think about them they are quite different from what i expected - so old and young and so UNK and sad as it were frodo looked at sam rather startled half expecting to see some UNK sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him it did not sound like the voice of the old sam gamgee that he thought he knew but it looked like the old sam gamgee sitting there except that his face was unusually UNK do you feel any need to leave the shire now - now that your wish to see them has come true already he asked yes sir i dont know how to say it but after last night i feel different i seem to see ahead in a kind of way i know we are going to take a very long road into darkness but i know i cant turn back it isnt to see elves now nor dragons nor mountains that i want -  dont rightly know what i want but i have something to do before the end and it lies ahead not in the shire i must see it through sir if you understand me i dont altogether but i understand that gandalf chose me a good companion i am content we will go together frodo finished his breakfast in silence then standing up he looked over the land ahead and called to pippin all ready to start he said as pippin ran up we must be getting off at once we slept late and there are a good many miles to go you slept late you mean said pippin i was up long before and we are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking i have finished both now and i am going to make for bucklebury ferry as quickly as possible i am not going out of the way back to the road we left last night i am going to cut straight across country from here then you are going to fly said pippin you wont cut straight on foot anywhere in this country we can cut UNK than the road anyway answered frodo the ferry is east from woodhall but the hard road UNK away to the left UNK can see a bend of it away north over there it goes round the north end of the marish so as to strike the causeway from the bridge above stock but that is miles out of the way we could save a UNK of the distance if we made a line for the ferry from where we stand short UNK make long UNK  UNK pippin the country is rough round here and there are UNK and all kinds of UNK down in the marish UNK know the land in these parts and if you are worrying about black riders i cant see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a wood or a field it is less easy to find people in the woods and fields answered frodo and if you are supposed to be on the road there is some chance that you will be looked for on the road and not off it all right said pippin i will follow you into every bog and UNK but it is hard i had UNK on passing the golden perch at stock before UNK the best beer in the eastfarthing or used to be it is a long time since i UNK it that UNK it said frodo short UNK make UNK but UNK make longer ones at all UNK we must keep you away from the golden perch we want to get to bucklebury before dark what do you say sam i will go along with you mr frodo said sam in spite of private UNK and a deep regret for the best beer in the eastfarthing then if we are going to toil through bog and UNK lets go now said pippin it was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before but clouds were beginning to come up from the west it looked likely to turn to rain the hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick trees below their course had been chosen to leave woodhall to their left and to cut slanting through the woods that UNK along the eastern side of the hills until they reached the flats beyond then they could make straight for the ferry over country that was open except for a few UNK and fences frodo reckoned they had UNK miles to go in a straight line he soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had appeared there were no paths in the undergrowth and they did not get on very fast when they had struggled to the bottom of the bank they found a stream running down from the hills behind in a deeply UNK bed with steep UNK sides overhung with brambles most UNK it cut across the line they had chosen they could not UNK over it nor indeed get across it at all without getting wet scratched and muddy they halted wondering what to do first UNK said pippin smiling grimly sam gamgee looked back through an opening in the trees he caught a glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down look he said clutching frodo by the arm they all looked and on the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing beside it stooped a black figure they at once gave up any idea of going back frodo led the way and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream UNK he said to pippin we were both right the short cut has gone crooked already but we got under cover only just in time youve got sharp ears sam can you hear anything coming they stood still almost holding their breath as they listened but there was no sound of pursuit i dont fancy he would try bringing his horse down that bank said sam but i guess he knows we came down it we had better be going on going on was not altogether easy they had packs to carry and the bushes and brambles were reluctant to let them through they were cut off from the wind by the ridge behind and the air was still and UNK when they forced their way at last into more open ground they were hot and tired and very scratched and they were also no longer certain of the direction in which they were going the banks of the stream sank as it reached the UNK and became broader and UNK wandering off towards the marish and the river why this is the UNK said pippin if we are going to try and get back on to our course we must cross at once and bear right they UNK the stream and hurried over a wide open space UNK and treeless on the further side beyond that they came again to a belt of trees tall UNK for the most part with here and there an elm tree or an ash the ground was fairly level and there was little undergrowth but the trees were UNK close for them to see far ahead the leaves blew upwards in sudden UNK of wind and UNK of rain began to fall from the UNK sky then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down they trudged along as fast as they could over patches of grass and through thick UNK of old leaves and all about them the rain UNK and UNK they did not talk but kept glancing back and from side to side after half an hour pippin said i hope we have not turned too much towards the south and are not walking UNK through this wood it is not a very broad belt i should have said no more than a mile at the UNK - and we ought to have been through it by now it is no good our starting to go in UNK said frodo that wont UNK matters let us keep on as we are going i am not sure that i want to come out into the open yet they went on for perhaps another couple of miles then the sun gleamed out of UNK clouds again and the rain UNK it was now past mid-day and they felt it was high time for lunch they halted under an elm tree its leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick and the ground at its feel was fairly dry and sheltered when they came to make their meal they found that the elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink pale golden in colour it had the scent of a UNK made of many flowers and was UNK UNK very soon they were laughing and UNK their fingers at rain and at black riders the last few miles they felt would soon be behind them frodo UNK his back against the UNK and closed his eyes sam and pippin sat near and they began to UNK and then to sing softly ho ho ho to the UNK i go to heal my heart and UNK my UNK rain may fall and wind may blow and many miles be still to go but under a tall tree i will lie and let the clouds go sailing by ho ho ho they began again louder they stopped short suddenly frodo sprang to his feet a UNK UNK came down the wind like the cry of some evil and lonely creature it rose and fell and ended on a high piercing note even as they sat and stood as if suddenly frozen it was answered by another cry UNK and further off but no less UNK to the blood there was then a silence broken only by the sound of the wind in the leaves and what do you think that was pippin asked at last trying to speak lightly but UNK a little if it was a bird it was one that i never heard in the shire before it was not bird or beast said frodo it was a call or a UNK  there were words in that cry though i could not catch them but no hobbit has such a voice no more was said about it they were all thinking of the riders but no one spoke of them they were now reluctant either to stay or go on but sooner or later they had got to get across the open country to the ferry and it was best to go sooner and in daylight in a few UNK they had UNK their packs again and were off before long the wood came to a sudden end wide UNK stretched before them they now saw that they had in fact turned too much to the south away over the flats they could glimpse the low hill of bucklebury across the river but it was now to their left creeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees they set off across the open as quickly as they could at first they felt afraid away from the shelter of the wood far back behind them stood the high place where they had UNK frodo half expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky but there was no sign of one the sun escaping from the breaking clouds as it sank towards the hills they had left was now shining brightly again their fear left them though they still felt uneasy but the land became steadily more UNK and well-ordered soon they came into UNK fields and meadows there were hedges and gates and UNK for UNK everything seemed quiet and peaceful just an ordinary corner of the shire their spirits rose with every step the line of the river grew nearer and the black riders began to seem like UNK of the woods now left far behind they passed along the edge of a huge UNK and came to a stout gate beyond it a UNK lane ran between low UNK hedges towards a distant UNK of trees pippin stopped i know these fields and this gate he said this is UNK old farmer maggots land thats his farm away there in the trees one trouble after another said frodo looking nearly as much alarmed as if pippin had declared the lane was the UNK leading to a dragons UNK the others looked at him in surprise whats wrong with old maggot asked pippin hes a good friend to all the brandy UNK of course hes a terror to UNK and UNK UNK dogs - but after all folk down here are near the border and have to be more on their guard i know said frodo but all the same he added with a UNK laugh i am terrified of him and his dogs i have UNK his farm for years and years he caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms when i was a UNK at brandy hall on the last occasion he beat me and then took me and showed me to his dogs see UNK he said next time this young UNK UNK foot on my land you can eat him now see him off they UNK me all the way to the ferry i have never got over the UNK - though i daresay the beasts knew their business and would not really have touched me pippin laughed well its time you made it up especially if you are coming back to live in buckland old maggot is really a stout fellow - if you leave his mushrooms alone UNK get into the lane and then we shant be trespassing if we meet him ill do the talking he is a friend of merrys and i used to come here with him a good deal at one time they went along the lane until they saw the UNK UNK of a large house and UNK peeping out among the trees ahead the maggots and the UNK of stock and most of the inhabitants of the marish were UNK and this farm was UNK built of brick and had a high wall all round it there was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane suddenly as they drew nearer a UNK UNK and UNK broke out and a loud voice was heard shouting grip UNK wolf come on UNK frodo and sam stopped dead but pippin walked on a few UNK the gate opened and three huge dogs came UNK out into the lane and dashed towards the travellers UNK fiercely they took no notice of pippin but sam shrank against the wall while two UNK dogs UNK at him suspiciously and UNK if he moved the UNK and most UNK of the three halted in front of frodo bristling and UNK through the gate there now appeared a broad thick UNK hobbit with a round red face hallo hallo and who may you be and what may you be wanting he asked good afternoon mr maggot said pippin the farmer looked at him closely well if it isnt master pippin - mr peregrin took i should say he cried changing from a UNK to a UNK its a long time since i saw you round here its lucky for you that i know you i was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers there are some funny things going on today of course we do get queer folk wandering in these parts at times too near the river he said shaking his head but this fellow was the most outlandish i have ever set eyes on he wont cross my land without leave a second time not if i can stop it what fellow do you mean asked pippin then you havent seen him said the farmer he went up the lane towards the causeway not a long while back he was a funny UNK and asking funny questions but perhaps youll come along inside and well pass the news more comfortable ive a drop of good ale on UNK if you and your friends are willing mr took it seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more if allowed to do it in his own time and fashion so they all accepted the UNK what about the dogs asked frodo anxiously the farmer laughed they wont harm you - not unless i tell UNK to here grip UNK UNK he cried UNK wolf to the relief of frodo and sam the dogs walked away and let them go free pippin introduced the other two to the farmer mr frodo baggins he said you may not remember him but he used to live at brandy hall at the name baggins the farmer started and gave frodo a sharp glance for a moment frodo thought that the memory of UNK mushrooms had been UNK and that the dogs would be told to see him off but farmer maggot took him by the arm well if that isnt UNK than ever he exclaimed mr baggins is it come inside we must have a talk they went into the farmers kitchen and sat by the wide UNK mrs maggot brought out beer in a huge UNK and filled four large mugs it was a good UNK and pippin found himself more than UNK for missing the golden perch sam UNK his beer suspiciously he had a natural UNK of the inhabitants of other parts of the shire and also he was not UNK to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master however long ago after a few UNK about the weather and the UNK UNK which were no worse than usual farmer maggot put down his mug and looked at them all in turn now mr peregrin he said where might you be coming from and where might you be going to were you coming to visit me for if so you had gone past my gate without my seeing you well no answered pippin to tell you the truth since you have guessed it we got into the lane from the other end we had come over your fields but that was quite by accident we lost our way in the woods back near woodhall trying to take a short cut to the ferry if you were in a hurry the road would have served you better said the farmer but i wasnt worrying about that you have leave to walk over my land if you have a mind mr peregrin and you mr baggins - though i daresay you still like mushrooms he laughed ah yes i UNK the name i UNK the time when young frodo baggins was one of the worst young UNK of buckland but it wasnt mushrooms i was thinking of i had just heard the name baggins before you turned up what do you think that funny UNK asked me they waited anxiously for him to go on well the farmer continued approaching his point with slow UNK he came riding on a big black horse in at the gate which happened to be open and right up to my door all black he was himself too and cloaked and UNK up as if he did not want to be known now what in the shire can he want i thought to myself we dont see many of the big folk over the border and anyway i had never heard of any like this black fellow  UNK to you i says going out to him this lane dont lead anywhere and wherever you may be going your UNK way will be back to the road i didnt like the looks of him and when grip came out he took one sniff and let out a UNK as if he had been UNK he put down his tail and bolted off howling the black fellow sat quite still  i come from yonder he said slow and UNK pointing back west over my fields if you please have you seen baggins  he asked in a queer voice and bent down towards me i could not see any face for his hood fell down so low and i felt a sort of UNK down my back but i did not see why he should come riding over my land so bold  be off i said there are no bagginses here youre in the wrong part of the shire you had better go back west to hobbiton - but you can go by road this time  baggins has left he answered in a whisper he is coming he is not far away i wish to find him if he passes will you tell me i will come back with gold  no you wont i said youll go back where you belong double quick i give you one minute before i call all my dogs he gave a sort of hiss it might have been laughing and it might not then he UNK his great horse right at me and i jumped out of the way only just in time i called the dogs but he swung off and rode through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder what do you think of that frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire but his only thought was how on earth would they reach the ferry i dont know what to think he said at last then ill tell you what to think said maggot you should never have gone UNK yourself up with hobbiton folk mr frodo folk are queer up there sam stirred in his chair and looked at the farmer with an unfriendly eye but you were always a UNK lad when i heard you had left the brandybucks and gone off to that old mr bilbo i said that you were going to find trouble mark my words this all comes of those strange doings of mr bilbos his money was got in some strange fashion in UNK parts they say maybe there is some that want to know what has become of the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of hobbiton as i hear frodo said nothing the UNK guesses of the farmer were rather UNK well mr frodo maggot went on im glad that youve had the sense to come back to buckland my advice is stay there and dont get mixed up with these outlandish folk youll have friends in these parts if any of these black fellows come after you again ill deal with them ill say youre dead or have left the shire or anything you like and that might be true enough for as like as not it is old mr bilbo they want news of maybe youre right said frodo UNK the farmers eye and staring at the fire maggot looked at him thoughtfully well i see you have UNK of your own he said it is as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and that rider here on the same afternoon and maybe my news was no great news to you after all i am not asking you to tell me anything you have a mind to keep to yourself but i see you are in some kind of trouble perhaps you are thinking it wont be too easy to get to the ferry without being caught i was thinking so said frodo but we have got to try and get there and it wont be done by sitting and thinking UNK am afraid we must be going thank you very much indeed for your kindness ive been in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty years farmer maggot though you may laugh to hear it its a pity for ive missed a good friend and now im sorry to leave so soon but ill come back perhaps one day - if i get a chance youll be welcome when you come said maggot but now ive a notion its near UNK already and we are going to have our supper for we mostly go to bed soon after the sun if you and mr peregrin and all could stay and have a bite with us we would be pleased and so should we said frodo but we must be going at once im afraid even now it will be dark before we can reach the ferry ah but wait a minute i was going to say after a bit of supper ill gel out a small waggon and ill drive you all to the ferry that will save you a good step and it might also save you trouble of another sort frodo now accepted the UNK UNK to the relief of pippin and sam the sun was already behind the western hills and the light was failing two of maggots sons and his three UNK came in and a generous supper was laid on the large table the kitchen was lit with candles and the fire was mended mrs maggot UNK in and out one or two other hobbits UNK to the UNK came in in a short while UNK sat down to eat there was beer in plenty and a mighty dish of mushrooms and UNK besides much other solid UNK fare the dogs lay by the fire and UNK UNK and cracked bones when they had finished the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern and got the waggon ready it was dark in the yard when the guests came out they threw their packs on UNK and climbed in the farmer sat in the UNK and UNK up his two stout ponies his wife stood in the light of the open door you be careful of yourself maggot she called dont go UNK with any UNK and come straight back i will said he and drove out of the gate there was now no breath of wind UNK the night was still and quiet and a chill was in the air they went without lights and took it slowly after a mile or two the lane came to an end crossing a deep dike and climbing a short slope up on to the UNK causeway maggot got down and took a good look either way north and south but nothing could be seen in the darkness and there was not a sound in the still air thin strands of river UNK were hanging above the UNK and crawling over the fields its going to be thick said maggot but ill not light my lantern till i turn for home well hear anything on the road long before we meet it tonight it was five miles or more from maggots lane to the ferry the hobbits wrapped themselves up but their ears were UNK for any sound above the creak of the UNK and the slow UNK of the ponies hoofs the waggon seemed slower than a UNK to frodo beside him pippin was nodding towards sleep but sam was staring forwards into the rising fog they reached the entrance to the ferry lane at last it was marked by two tall white UNK that suddenly loomed up on their right farmer maggot drew in his ponies and the waggon UNK to a halt they were just beginning lo UNK out when suddenly they heard what they had all been UNK hoofs on the road ahead the sound was coming towards them maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies heads and peering forward into the gloom UNK UNK came the approaching rider the fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still foggy air youd better be hidden mr frodo said sam anxiously you get down in the waggon and cover up with blankets and well send this rider to the UNK he climbed out and went to the farmers side black riders would have to ride over him to get near the waggon UNK UNK the rider was nearly on them hallo there called farmer maggot the UNK hoofs stopped short they thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist a yard or two ahead now then said the farmer throwing the UNK to sam and UNK forward dont you come a step nearer what do you want and where are you going i want mr baggins have you seen him said a muffled voice - but the voice was the voice of merry brandybuck a dark lantern was uncovered and its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer mr merry he cried yes of course who did you think it was said merry coming forward as he came out of the mist and their fears UNK he seemed suddenly to UNK to ordinary UNK he was riding a pony and a UNK was UNK round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him so there you are at last said merry i was beginning to wonder if you would turn up at all today and i was just going back to supper when it grew foggy i came across and rode up towards stock to see if you had fallen in any UNK but im UNK if i know which way you have come where did you find them mr maggot in your UNK no i caught UNK trespassing said the farmer and nearly set my dogs on UNK but theyll tell you all the story ive no doubt now if youll UNK me mr merry and mr frodo and all id best be turning for home mrs maggot will be UNK with the night getting thick he UNK the waggon into the lane and turned it well good night to you all he said its been a queer day and no mistake but UNK well as ends well though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own doors ill not deny that ill be glad now when i do he lit his lanterns and got up suddenly he UNK a large basket from under the seat i was nearly forgetting he said mrs maggot put this up for mr baggins with her UNK he handed it down and moved off followed by a chorus of UNK and UNK they watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as they dwindled into the foggy night suddenly frodo laughed from the covered basket he held the scent of mushrooms was rising chapter   a conspiracy UNK now we had better get home ourselves said merry theres something funny about all this i see but it must wait till we get in they turned down the ferry lane which was straight and UNK and UNK with large UNK washed stones in a hundred yards or so it brought them to the river -bank where there was a broad wooden UNK a large flat UNK was moored beside it the white UNK near the waters edge UNK in the light of two lamps on high UNK behind them the mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges but the water before them was dark with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by the bank there seemed to be less fog on the further side merry led the pony over a UNK on to the ferry and the others followed merry then pushed slowly off with a long UNK the brandywine flowed slow and broad before them on the other side the bank was steep and up it a winding path climbed from the further landing lamps were twinkling there behind loomed up the UNK hill and out of it through stray UNK of mist shone many round windows yellow and red they were the windows of brandy hall the ancient home of the brandy UNK long ago UNK UNK head of the UNK family one of the oldest in the marish or indeed in the shire had crossed the river which was the original UNK of the land eastwards he built and UNK brandy hall changed his name to brandybuck and settled down to become master of what was UNK a small UNK country his family grew and grew and after his days continued to grow until brandy hall occupied the whole of the low hill and had three large UNK many UNK and about a hundred windows the brandybucks and their numerous UNK then began to UNK and later to build all round about that was the origin of buckland a UNK inhabited strip between the river and the old forest a sort of UNK from the shire its chief village was bucklebury UNK in the banks and slopes behind brandy hall the people in the marish were friendly with the bucklanders and the authority of the master of the hall as the head of the brandybuck family was called was still UNK by the farmers between stock and UNK but most of the folk of the old shire regarded the bucklanders as peculiar half UNK as it were though as a matter of fact they were not very different from the other hobbits of the four farthings except in one point they were fond of boats and some of them could swim their land was UNK UNK from the east but on that side they had built a hedge the high UNK it had been planted many generations ago and was now thick and tail for it was constantly tended it ran all the way from brandywine bridge in a big loop curving away from the river to UNK where the withywindle flowed out of the forest into the brandywine well over twenty miles from end to end but of course it was not a complete protection the forest drew close to the hedge in many places the bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark and that also was not usual in the shire the UNK moved slowly across the water the buckland shore drew nearer sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river before he had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by his old life lay behind in the mists dark adventure lay in front he scratched his head and for a moment had a passing wish that mr frodo could have gone on living quietly at bag end the four hobbits stepped off the ferry merry was UNK it up and pippin was already leading the pony up the path when sam who had been looking back as if to take farewell of the shire said in a hoarse whisper look back mr frodo do you see anything on the far stage under the distant lamps they could just make out a figure it looked like a dark black UNK left behind but as they looked it seemed to move and sway this way and that as if searching the ground it then crawled or went crouching back into the gloom beyond the lamps what in the shire is that exclaimed merry something that is following us said frodo but dont ask any more now lets get away at once they hurried up the path to the top of the bank but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist and nothing could be seen thank UNK you dont keep any boats on the west -bank said frodo can horses cross the river they can go twenty miles north to brandywine bridge - or they might swim answered merry though i never heard of any horse swimming the brandywine but what have horses to do with it ill tell you later lets get indoors and then we can talk all right you and pippin know your way so ill just ride on and tell fatty bolger that you are coming well see about supper and things we had our supper early with farmer maggot said frodo but we could do with another you shall have it give me that basket said merry and rode ahead into the darkness it was some distance from the brandywine to frodos new house at crickhollow they passed UNK hill and brandy hall on their left and on the UNK of bucklebury struck the main road of buckland that ran south from the bridge half a mile northward along this they came to a lane opening on their right this they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and down into the country at last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge nothing could be seen of the house in the dark it stood back from the lane in the middle of a wide circle of lawn UNK by a belt of low trees inside the outer hedge frodo had chosen it because it stood in an UNK corner of the country and there were no other dwellings close by you could get in and out without being noticed it had been built a long while before by the brandybucks for the use of guests or members of the family that wished to escape from the crowded life of brandy hall for a time it was an UNK UNK house as much like a UNK as possible it was long and low with no upper UNK and it had a roof of turf round windows and a large round door as they walked lip the green path from the gate no light was visible the windows were dark and UNK frodo UNK on the door and fatty bolger opened it a friendly light streamed out they slipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light inside they were in a wide hall with doors on either side in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the house well what do you think of it asked merry coming up the passage we have done our best in a short time to make it look like home after all fatty and i only got here with the last UNK yesterday frodo looked round it did look like home many of his own favourite things - or bilbos things they UNK him sharply of him in their new selling - were UNK as nearly as possible as they had been at bag end it was a pleasant comfortable UNK place and he found himself UNK that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet UNK it seemed UNK to have put his friends to all this trouble and he wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave them so soon indeed at once yet that would have to be done that very night before they all went to bed its UNK he said with an effort i hardly feel that i have moved at all the travellers hung up their cloaks and piled their packs on the floor merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end firelight came out and a UNK of steam a UNK cried pippin o blessed meriadoc which order shall we go in said frodo eldest first or UNK first youll be last either way master peregrin trust me to UNK things better than that said merry we cant begin life at crickhollow with a UNK over UNK in that room there are three UNK and a UNK full of UNK water there are also UNK UNK and UNK get inside and be quick merry and fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage and UNK themselves with the final preparations for a late supper UNK of UNK songs came from the UNK mixed with the sound of UNK and UNK the voice of pippin was suddenly lifted up above the others in one of bilbos favourite UNK sing hey for the UNK at close of day that UNK the weary mud away a UNK is he that will not sing o water hot is a noble thing o sweet is the sound of falling rain and the UNK that UNK from hill to plain but better than rain or rippling streams is water hot that UNK and UNK o water cold we may UNK at need down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed but better is beer if drink we lack and water hot UNK down the back o water is fair that UNK on high in a fountain white beneath the sky but never did fountain sound so sweet as UNK hot water with my feet there was a UNK splash and a shout of whoa from frodo it appeared that a lot of UNK UNK had UNK a fountain and leaped on high merry went to the door what about supper and beer in the throat he called frodo came out UNK his hair theres so much water in the air that im coming into the kitchen to finish he said UNK said merry looking in the stone floor was swimming you ought to UNK all that up before you get anything to eat peregrin he said hurry up or we shant wait for you they had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire i suppose you three wont want mushrooms again said fredegar without much hope yes we shall cried pippin theyre mine said frodo given to me by mrs maggot a queen among farmers UNK take your UNK hands away and ill serve them hobbits have a UNK for mushrooms UNK even the UNK UNK of big people a fact which partly UNK young frodos long UNK to the UNK fields of the marish and the wrath of the UNK maggot on this occasion there was plenty for all even according to hobbit UNK there were also many other things to follow and when they had finished even fatty bolger UNK a UNK of content they pushed back the table and drew chairs round the fire well clear up later said merry now tell me all about it i guess that you have been having adventures which was not quite fair without me i want a full account and most of all i want to know what was the matter with old maggot and why he spoke to me like that he sounded almost as if he was scared if that is possible we have all been scared said pippin after a UNK in which frodo stared at the fire and did not speak you would have been too if you had been UNK for two days by black riders and what are they black figures riding on black horses answered pippin if frodo wont talk i will tell you the whole tale from the beginning he then gave a full account of their journey from the time when they left hobbiton sam gave various UNK UNK and UNK frodo remained silent i should think you were making it all up said merry if i had not seen that black shape on the UNK - and heard the queer sound in maggots voice what do you make of it all frodo cousin frodo has been very close said pippin but the time has come for him to open out so far we have been given nothing more to go on than farmer maggots guess that it has something to do with old bilbos treasure that was only a guess said frodo hastily maggot does not know anything old maggot is a UNK fellow said merry a lot goes on behind his round face that does not come out in his talk ive heard that he used to go into the old forest at one time and he has the reputation of knowing a good many strange things but you can at least tell us frodo whether you think his guess good or bad i think  answered frodo slowly that it was a good guess as far as it goes there is a UNK with bilbos old adventures and the riders are looking or perhaps one ought to say searching for him or for me i also fear if you want to know that it is no joke at all and that i am not safe here or anywhere else he looked round at the windows and walls as if he was afraid they would suddenly give way the others looked at him in silence and UNK meaning UNK among themselves its coming out in a minute whispered pippin to merry merry nodded well said frodo at last sitting up and UNK his back as if he had made a decision i cant keep it dark any longer i have got something to tell you all but i dont know quite how to begin i think i could help you said merry quietly by telling you some of it myself what do you mean said frodo looking at him anxiously just this my dear old frodo you are miserable because you dont know how to say good-bye you meant to leave the shire of course but danger has come on you sooner than you expected and now you are making up your mind to go at once and you dont want to we are very sorry for you frodo opened his mouth and shut it again his look of surprise was so UNK that they laughed dear old frodo said pippin did you really think you had thrown dust in all our eyes you have not been nearly careful or clever enough for that you have obviously been UNK to go and saying farewell to all your UNK all this year since UNK we have constantly heard you muttering shall i ever look down into that valley again i wonder and things like that and UNK that you had come to the end of your money and actually selling your beloved bag end to those sackville-bagginses and all those close talks with gandalf good heavens said frodo i thought i had been both careful and clever i dont know what gandalf would say is all the shire discussing my departure then oh no said merry dont worry about that the secret wont keep for long of course but at present it is i think only known to us UNK after all you must remember that we know you well and are often with you we can usually guess what you are thinking i knew bilbo too to tell you the truth i had been watching you rather closely ever since he left i thought you would go after him sooner or later indeed i expected you to go sooner and lately we have been very anxious we have been terrified that you might give us the slip and go off suddenly all on your own like he did ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open and done a good deal of UNK on our own account you are not going to escape so easily but i must go said frodo it cannot be helped dear friends it is wretched for us all but it is no use your trying to keep me since you have guessed so much please help me and do not hinder me you do not understand said pippin you must go - and therefore we must too merry and i are coming with you sam is an excellent fellow and would UNK down a dragons throat to save you if he did not UNK over his own feet but you will need more than one companion in your dangerous adventure my dear and most beloved hobbits said frodo deeply moved but i could not allow it i decided that long ago too you speak of danger but you do not understand this is no UNK no UNK UNK journey i am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril of course we understand said merry firmly that is why we have decided to come we know the ring is no laughing UNK but we are going to do our best to help you against the enemy the ring said frodo now UNK UNK yes the ring said merry my dear old hobbit you dont allow for the UNK of friends i have known about the UNK of the ring for years - before bilbo went away in fact but since he obviously regarded it as secret i kept the knowledge in my head until we formed our conspiracy i did not know bilbo of course as well as i know you i was too young and he was also more careful - but he was not careful enough if you want to know how i first found out i will tell you go on said frodo faintly it was the sackville-bagginses that were his UNK as you might expect one day a year before the party i happened to be walking along the road when i saw bilbo ahead suddenly in the distance the s-bs appeared coming towards us bilbo UNK down and then hey UNK he vanished i was so startled that i hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion but i got through the hedge and walked along the field inside i was peeping through into the road after the s-bs had passed and was looking straight at bilbo when he suddenly reappeared i caught a glint of gold as he put something back in his UNK UNK after that i kept my eyes open in fact i UNK that i UNK but you must admit that it was very UNK and i was only in my UNK i must be the only one in the shire besides you frodo that has ever seen the old fellows secret book you have read his book cried frodo good heavens above is nothing safe not too safe i should say said merry but i have only had one UNK glance and that was difficult to get he never left the book about i wonder what became of it i should like another look have you got it frodo no it was not at bag end he must have taken it away well as i was saying merry UNK i kept my knowledge to myself till this spring when things got serious then we formed our conspiracy and as we were serious too and meant business we have not been too UNK you are not a very easy UNK to crack and gandalf is worse but if you want to be introduced to our chief UNK i can UNK him where is he said frodo looking round as if he expected a UNK and UNK figure to come out of a UNK step forward sam said merry and sam stood up with a face UNK up to the ears heres our UNK of information  and he collected a lot i can tell you before he was finally caught after which i may say he seemed to UNK himself as on UNK and UNK up sam cried frodo feeling that amazement could go no further and quite unable to decide whether he felt angry UNK relieved or merely foolish yes sir said sam begging your pardon sir but i meant no wrong to you mr frodo nor to mr gandalf for that matter he has some sense mind you and when you said go alone he said no lake someone as you can trust  but it does not seem that i can trust anyone said frodo sam looked at him UNK it all depends on what you want put in merry you can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin - to the bitter end and you can trust us to keep any secret of yours - closer than you keep it yourself but you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone and go off without a word we are your friends frodo anyway there it is we know most of what gandalf has told you we know a good deal about the ring we are UNK afraid - but we are coming with you or following you like UNK and after all sir added sam you did ought to take the elves advice gildor said you should take them as was willing and you cant deny it i dont deny it said frodo looking at sam who was now UNK i dont deny it but ill never believe you are sleeping again whether you UNK or not i shall UNK you hard to make sure you are a set of UNK UNK he said turning to the others but bless you he laughed getting up and waving his arms i give in i will take UNK advice if the danger were not so dark i should dance for joy even so i cannot help feeling happy happier than i have felt for a long time i had dreaded this evening good thats settled three cheers for captain frodo and company they shouted and they danced round him merry and pippin began a song which they had UNK got ready for the occasion it was made on the UNK of the UNK that started bilbo on his adventure long ago and went to the same tune farewell we call to hearth and hall though wind may blow and rain may fall we must away ere break of day far over wood and mountain tall to rivendell where elves yet dwell in UNK beneath the misty fell through UNK and waste we ride in haste and whither then we cannot tell with foes ahead behind us dread beneath the sky shall be our bed until at last our toil be passed our journey done our errand sped we must away we must away we ride before the break of day very good said frodo but in that case there are a lot of things to do before we go to bed - under a roof for tonight at any rate oh that was poetry said pippin do you really mean to start before the break of day i dont know answered frodo i fear those black riders and i am sure it is UNK to stay in one place long especially in a place to which it is known i was going also gildor UNK me not to wait but i should very much like to see gandalf i could see that even gildor was disturbed when he heard that gandalf had never appeared it really depends on two things flow soon could the riders get to bucklebury and how soon could we get off it will take a good deal of UNK the answer to the second question said merry is that we could get off in an hour i have prepared UNK everything there are six ponies in a UNK across the fields UNK and UNK are all packed except for a few UNK clothes and the UNK food it seems to have been a very UNK conspiracy said frodo but what about the black riders would it be safe to wait one day for gandalf that all depends on what you think the riders would do if they found you here answered merry they could have reached here by now of course if they were not stopped at the north-gate where the hedge runs down to the river -bank just this side of the bridge the UNK would not let them through by night though they might break through even in the daylight they would try to keep them out i think at any rate until they got a message through to the master of the hall - for they would not like the look of the riders and would certainly be frightened by them but of course buckland cannot resist a UNK attack for long and it is possible that in the morning even a black rider that rode up and asked for mr baggins would be let through it is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at crickhollow frodo sat for a while in thought i have made up my mind he said finally i am starting tomorrow as soon as it is light but i am not going by road it would be UNK to wait here than that if i go through the north-gate my departure from buckland will be known at once instead of being secret for several days at least as it might be and what is more the bridge and the east road near the borders will certainly be watched whether any rider UNK into buckland or not we dont know how many there are but there are at least two and possibly more the only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected direction but that can only mean going into the old forest said fredegar UNK you cant be thinking of doing that it is quite as dangerous as black riders not quite said merry it sounds very desperate but i believe frodo is right it is the only way of getting off without being followed at once with luck we might gel a UNK start but you wont have any luck in the old forest UNK fredegar no one ever has luck in there youll gel lost people dont go in there oh yes they do said merry the brandybucks go in - occasionally when the fit takes them we have a private entrance frodo went in once long ago i have been in several times usually in daylight of course when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet well do as you think best said fredegar i am more afraid of the old forest than of anything i know about the stories about it are a UNK but my vote hardly UNK as i am not going on the journey still i am very glad someone is UNK behind who can tell gandalf what you have done when he turns up as i am sure he will before long fond as he was of frodo fatty bolger had no desire to leave the shire nor to see what lay outside it his family came from the eastfarthing from UNK in UNK in fact but he had never been over the brandywine bridge his task according to the original plans of the UNK was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk and to keep up as long as possible the UNK that mr baggins was still living at crickhollow he had even brought along some old clothes of frodos to help him in UNK the part they little thought how dangerous that part might prove excellent said frodo when he understood the plan we could not have left any message behind for gandalf otherwise i dont know whether these riders can read or not of course but i should not have dared to risk a written message in case they got in and searched the house but if fatty is willing to hold the UNK and i can be sure of gandalf knowing the way we have gone that UNK me i am going into the old forest first thing tomorrow well thats that said pippin on the whole i would rather have our job than UNK - waiting here till black riders come you wait till you are well inside the forest said fredegar youll wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow its no good UNK about it any more said merry we have still got to UNK up and put the UNK UNK to the packing before we get to bed i shall call you all before the break of day when at last he had got to bed frodo could not sleep for some time his legs UNK he was glad that he was riding in the morning eventually he fell into a vague dream in which he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark sea of tangled trees down below among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and UNK he felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later then he heard a noise in the distance at first he thought it was a great wind coming over the leaves of the forest then he knew that it was not leaves but the sound of the sea UNK a sound he had never heard in waking life though it had often troubled his dreams suddenly he found he was out in the open there were no trees after all he was on a dark UNK and there was a strange UNK smell in the air looking up he saw before him a tall white tower standing alone on a high ridge a great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the sea he started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower but suddenly a light came in the sky and there was a noise of thunder chapter  the old forest frodo woke suddenly it was still dark in the room merry was standing there with a candle in one hand and UNK on the door with the other all right what is it said frodo still shaken and UNK what is it cried merry it is time to get up it is half past four and very foggy come on sam is already getting breakfast ready even pippin is up i am just going to saddle the ponies and fetch the one that is to be the UNK wake that UNK fatty at least he must get up and see us off soon after six oclock the five hobbits were ready to start fatty bolger was still UNK they stole quietly out of the house merry went in front leading a laden pony and took his way along a path that went through a UNK behind the house and then cut across several fields the leaves of trees were glistening and every UNK was dripping the grass was grey with cold dew everything was still and UNK noises seemed near and clear UNK UNK in a yard someone closing a door of a distant house in their UNK they found the ponies sturdy little beasts of the kind loved by hobbits not UNK but good for a long days work they mounted and soon they were riding off into the mist which seemed to open reluctantly before them and close UNK behind them after riding for about an hour slowly and without talking they saw the UNK UNK suddenly ahead it was tall and UNK over with silver UNK how are you going to get through this asked fredegar follow me said merry and you will see he turned to the left along the hedge and soon they came to a point where it bent inwards running along the lip of a hollow a cutting had been made at some distance from the hedge and went sloping gently down into the ground it had walls of brick at the sides which rose steadily until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep under the hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side here fatty bolger halted good-bye frodo he said i wish you were not going into the forest i only hope you will not need UNK before the day is out but good luck to you - today and every day if there are no worse things ahead than the old forest i shall be lucky said frodo tell gandalf to hurry along the east road we shall soon be back on it and going as fast as we can good-bye they cried and rode down the slope and disappeared from UNK sight into the tunnel it was dark and damp at the far end it was closed by a gate of UNK iron UNK merry got down and UNK the gate and when they had all passed through he pushed it to again it shut with a UNK and the lock UNK the sound was ominous there said merry you have left the shire and are now outside and on the edge of the old forest are the stories about it true asked pippin i dont know what stories you mean merry answered if you mean the old UNK UNK UNK used to tell him about UNK and wolves and things of that sort i should say no at any rate i dont believe them but the forest is queer everything in it is very much more alive more aware of what is going on so to speak than things are in the shire and the trees do not like strangers they watch you they are usually content merely to watch you as long as daylight lasts and dont do much occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch or stick a root out or grasp at you with a long UNK but at night things can be most UNK or so i am told i have only once or twice been in here after dark and then only near the hedge i thought all the trees were whispering to each other passing news and UNK along in an UNK language and the branches swayed and groped without any wind they do say the trees do actually move and can UNK strangers and UNK them in in fact long ago they attacked the hedge they came and planted themselves right by it and leaned over it but the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees and made a great bonfire in the forest and burned all the ground in a long strip east of the hedge after that the trees gave up the attack but they became very unfriendly there is still a wide bare space not far inside where the bonfire was made is it only the trees that are dangerous asked pippin there are various queer things living deep in the forest and on the far side said merry or at least i have heard so but i have never seen any of them but something makes paths UNK one comes inside one finds open UNK but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer fashion not far from this tunnel there is or was for a long time the beginning of quite a broad path leading to the bonfire glade and then on more or less in our direction east and a little north that is the path i am going to try and find the hobbits now left the UNK and rode across the wide hollow on the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the forest a hundred yards and more beyond the hedge but it vanished as soon as it brought them under the trees looking back they could see the dark line of the hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them looking ahead they could see only tree-trunks of UNK UNK and shapes straight or bent twisted leaning UNK or slender smooth or gnarled and UNK and all the stems were green or grey with UNK and slimy UNK UNK merry alone seemed fairly cheerful you had better lead on and find that path frodo said to him dont let us lose one another or forget which way the hedge lies they picked a way among the trees and their ponies plodded along carefully UNK the many UNK and UNK roots there was no undergrowth the ground was rising steadily and as they went forward it seemed that the trees became taller darker and thicker there was no sound except an UNK UNK of UNK falling through the still leaves for the moment there was no whispering or movement among the branches but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being watched with UNK UNK to dislike and even UNK the feeling steadily grew until they found themselves looking up quickly or glancing back over their shoulders as if they expected a sudden blow there was not as yet any sign of a path and the trees seemed constantly to bar their way pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it any longer and without warning let out a shout UNK UNK  he cried i am not going to do anything just let me pass through will you the others halted startled but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy UNK there was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become more crowded and more watchful than before i should not shout if i were you said merry it does more harm than good frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through and if he had been right to make the others come into this abominable wood merry was looking from side to side and seemed already UNK which way to go pippin noticed it it has not taken you long to lose us he said but at that moment merry gave a UNK of relief and pointed ahead well well he said these trees do shift there is the bonfire glade in front of us or i hope so but the path to it seems to have moved away the light grew clearer as they went forward suddenly they came out of the trees and found themselves in a wide UNK space there was sky above them blue and clear to their surprise for down under the forest UNK they had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist the sun was not however high enough yet to shine down into the clearing though its light was on the tree-tops the leaves were all thicker and UNK about the edges of the glade UNK it with an almost solid wall no tree grew there only rough grass and many tall UNK UNK and faded UNK and UNK UNK UNK into UNK ashes and UNK UNK and UNK a dreary place but it seemed a UNK and cheerful garden after the close forest the hobbits felt encouraged and looked up hopefully at the UNK daylight in the sky at the far side of the glade there was a break in the wall of trees and a clear path beyond it they could see it running on into the wood wide in places and open above though every now and again the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs up this path they rode they were still climbing gently but they now went much quicker and with better heart for it seemed to them that the forest had UNK and was going to let them pass UNK after all but after a while the air began to get hot and UNK the trees drew close again on either side and they could no longer see far ahead now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood UNK on them so silent was it that the fall of their ponies hoofs UNK on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots seemed to UNK in their ears frodo tried to sing a song to UNK them but his voice sank to a murmur o wanderers in the UNK land despair not for though dark they stand all woods there be must end at last and see the open sun go past the setting sun the rising sun the days end or the day begun for east or west all woods must fail fail - even as he said the word his voice faded into silence the air seemed heavy and the making of words UNK just behind them a large branch fell from an old UNK tree with a crash into the path the trees seemed to close in before them they do not like all that about ending and failing said merry i should not sing any more at present wait till we do get to the edge and then well turn and give them a UNK chorus he spoke UNK and if he felt any great anxiety he did not show it the others did not answer they were UNK a heavy weight was UNK steadily on frodos heart and he UNK now with every step forward that he had ever thought of UNK the UNK of the trees he was indeed just about to stop and UNK going back if that was still possible when things took a new turn the path stopped climbing and became for a while nearly level the dark trees drew aside and ahead they could see the path going almost straight forward before them but some distance off there stood a green hill-top treeless rising like a UNK head out of the encircling wood the path seemed to be making UNK for it they now hurried forward again delighted with the thought of climbing out for a while above the roof of the forest the path UNK and then again began to climb upwards leading them at last to the foot of the steep hillside there it left the trees and faded into the turf the wood stood all round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown the hobbits led their ponies up winding round and round until they reached the top there they stood and gazed about them the air was gleaming and sunlit but UNK and they could not see to any great distance near at hand the mist was now almost gone though here and there it lay in hollows of the wood and to the south of them out of a deep fold cutting right across the forest the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke that said merry pointing with his hand that is the line of the withywindle it comes down out of the downs and flows south-west through the midst of the forest to join the brandywine below UNK we dont want to go that way the withywindle valley is said to be the UNK part of the whole wood - the centre from which all the UNK comes as it were the others looked in the direction that merry pointed out but they could see little but mists over the damp and UNK valley and beyond it the southern half of the forest faded from view the sun on the UNK was now getting hot it must have been about UNK oclock but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in other UNK in the west they could not make out either the line of the hedge or the valley of the brandywine beyond it northward where they looked most hopefully they could see nothing that might be the line of the great east road for which they were making they were on an island in a sea of trees and the UNK was veiled on the UNK side the ground fell very steeply as if the slopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees like UNK that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep waters they sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them while they ate their mid-day meal as the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far off in the east the UNK lines of the downs that lay beyond the old forest on that side that UNK them greatly for it was good to see a sight of anything beyond the woods borders though they did not mean to go that way if they could help it the barrow-downs had as UNK a reputation in UNK as the forest itself at length they made up their minds to go on again the path that had brought them to the hill reappeared on the northward side but they had not followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the right soon it began to UNK UNK and they guessed that it must actually be UNK towards the UNK UNK valley not at all the direction they wished lo take after some UNK they decided to leave this UNK path and strike northward for although they had not been able to see it from the hill-top the road must lie that way and it could not be many miles off also northward and to the left of the path the land seemed lo be UNK and more open climbing up to slopes where the trees were thinner and UNK and UNK UNK the UNK and ashes and other strange and nameless trees of the UNK wood at first their choice seemed to be good they got along at a fair speed though UNK they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemed UNK to have UNK eastwards but after a time the trees began to close in again just where they had appeared from a distance to be thinner and less tangled then deep UNK in the ground were discovered unexpectedly like the UNK of great UNK or wide UNK and UNK roads long UNK and choked with brambles these lay usually right across their line of march and could only be crossed by UNK down and out again which was UNK and difficult with their ponies each time they climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and UNK undergrowth which somehow would not yield to the left but only gave way when they turned to the right and they had to go some distance along the bottom before they could find a way up the further bank each time they clambered out the trees seemed deeper and darker and always to the left and upwards it was most difficult to find a way and they were forced to the right and downwards after an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction though they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all they were being UNK off and were simply following a course chosen for them - eastwards and southwards into the heart of the forest and not out of it the afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled into a fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met it was so sleep and overhung that it proved impossible to climb out of it again either forwards or backwards without leaving their ponies and their baggage behind all they could do was to follow the fold - downwards the ground grew soft and in places UNK springs appeared in the banks and soon they found themselves following a UNK that UNK and UNK through a UNK bed then the ground began to fall UNK and the UNK growing strong and UNK flowed and leaped swiftly downhill they were in a deep UNK UNK UNK by trees high above them after stumbling along for some way along the stream they came quite suddenly out of the gloom as if through a gate they saw the sunlight before them coming to the opening they found that they had made their way down through a cleft in a high sleep bank almost a cliff at its feet was a wide space of grass and reeds and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep a golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and UNK upon the hidden land between in the midst of it there wound UNK a dark river of brown water UNK with ancient willows arched over with willows blocked with fallen willows and UNK with UNK of faded UNK the air was thick with them fluttering yellow from the branches for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the valley and the reeds were UNK and the UNK were creaking well now i have at least some notion of where we are said merry we have come almost in the UNK direction to which we intended this is the river UNK UNK i will go on and UNK he passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses after a while he reappeared and reported that there was fairly solid ground between the UNK and the river in some places firm turf went down to the waters edge whats more he said there seems to be something like a UNK winding along on this side of the river if we turn left and follow it we shall be bound to come out on the east side of the forest eventually i dare say said pippin that is if the track goes on so far and does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there who made the track do you suppose and why i am sure it was not for our UNK i am getting very suspicious of this forest and everything in it and i begin to believe all the stories about it and have you any idea how far eastward we should have to go no said merry i havent i dont know in the least how far down the withywindle we are or who could possibly come here often enough to make a path along it but there is no other way out that i can see or think of there being nothing else for it they UNK out and merry led them to the path that he had discovered everywhere the reeds and grasses were UNK and tall in places far above their heads but once found the path was easy to follow as it turned and twisted picking out the UNK ground among the UNK and pools here and there it passed over other UNK running down UNK into the withywindle out of the higher UNK and at these points there were tree-trunks or UNK of UNK laid carefully across the hobbits began to feel very hot there were armies of flies of all kinds UNK round their ears and the afternoon sun was burning on their backs at last they came suddenly into a thin shade great grey branches reached across the path each step forward became more reluctant than the last sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their legs and falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes frodo felt his chin go down and his head UNK just in front of him pippin fell forward on to his knees frodo halted its no good he heard merry saying cant go another step without rest must have UNK its cool under the willows less flies frodo did not like the sound of this come on he cried we cant have a UNK yet we must get clear of the forest first but the others were too far gone to care beside them sam stood UNK and UNK UNK suddenly frodo himself felt sleep UNK him his head swam there now seemed hardly a sound in the air the flies had stopped UNK only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing a soft fluttering as of a song half whispered seemed to stir in the boughs above he lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning over him a huge UNK old and UNK UNK it looked its UNK branches going up like UNK arms with many UNK hands its UNK and twisted trunk gaping in wide UNK that UNK faintly as the boughs moved the leaves fluttering against the bright sky UNK him and he UNK over lying where he fell upon the grass merry and pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with their backs to the UNK behind them the great cracks UNK wide to UNK them as the tree swayed and UNK they looked up at the grey and yellow leaves moving softly against the light and singing they shut their eyes and then it seemed that they could almost hear words cool words saying something about water and sleep they gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow frodo lay for a while UNK with the sleep that was UNK him then with an effort he struggled to his feel again he felt a UNK desire for cool water wait for me sam he stammered must bathe feet a minute half in a dream he wandered forward to the UNK side of the tree where great winding roots grew out into the stream like gnarled UNK UNK down to drink he UNK one of these and paddled his hot feel in the cool brown water and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back against the tree sam sat down and scratched his head and yawned like a UNK he was worried the afternoon was getting late and he thought this sudden sleepiness UNK theres more behind this than sun and warm air he muttered to himself i dont like this great big tree i dont trust it UNK at it singing about sleep now this wont do at all he pulled himself to his feet and staggered off to see what had become of the ponies he found that two had wandered on a good way along the path and he had just caught them and brought them back towards the others when he heard two noises one loud and the other soft but very clear one was the splash of something heavy falling into the water the other was a noise like the UNK of a lock when a door quietly UNK fast he rushed back to the bank frodo was in the water close to the edge and a great UNK seemed to be over him and holding him down but he was not struggling sam gripped him by the jacket and dragged him from under the root and then with difficulty UNK him on to the bank almost at once he woke and UNK and UNK do you know sam he said at length the UNK tree threw me in i felt it the big root just twisted round and tipped me in you were dreaming i expect mr frodo said sam you shouldnt sit in such a place if you feel sleepy what about the others frodo asked i wonder what sort of dreams they are having they went round to the other side of the tree and then sam understood the UNK that he had heard pippin had vanished the crack by which he had laid himself had closed together so that not a UNK could be seen merry was trapped another crack had closed about his UNK his legs lay outside but the rest of him was inside a dark opening the edges of which gripped like a pair of UNK frodo and sam beat first upon the UNK where pippin had lain they then struggled UNK to UNK open the UNK of the crack that held poor merry it was quite useless what a foul thing to happen cried frodo wildly why did we ever come into this dreadful forest i wish we were all back at crickhollow he kicked the tree with all his strength UNK of his own feet a hardly UNK UNK ran through the stem and up into the branches the leaves rustled and whispered but with a sound now of faint and UNK laughter i suppose we havent got an axe among our luggage mr frodo asked sam i brought a little UNK for UNK firewood said frodo that wouldnt be much use wait a minute cried sam struck by an idea suggested by firewood we might do something with fire we might said frodo doubtfully we might UNK in UNK pippin alive inside we might try to hurt or UNK this tree to begin with said sam fiercely if it dont let them go ill have it down if i have to UNK it he ran to the ponies and before long came back with two UNK and a UNK quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves and bits of bark and made a pile of broken UNK and UNK sticks these they UNK against the trunk on the far side of the tree from the UNK as soon as sam had struck a UNK into the UNK it kindled the dry grass and a UNK of flame and smoke went up the UNK UNK little fingers of fire UNK against the dry scored UNK of the ancient tree and UNK it a UNK ran through the whole willow the leaves seemed to hiss above their heads with a sound of pain and anger a loud UNK came from merry and from far inside the tree they heard pippin give a muffled yell put it out put it out cried merry hell UNK me in two if you dont he says so who what shouted frodo rushing round to the other side of the tree put it out put it out begged merry the branches of the willow began to sway UNK there was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about as though they had dropped a stone into the quiet UNK of the river -valley and set up ripples of anger that ran out over the whole forest sam kicked at the little fire and UNK out the UNK but frodo without any clear idea of why he did so or what he hoped for ran along the path crying help help help it seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voice it was blown away from him by the UNK and drowned in a UNK of leaves as soon as the words left his mouth he felt desperate lost and UNK suddenly he slopped there was an answer or so he thought but it seemed to come from behind him away down the path further back in the forest he turned round and listened and soon there could be no doubt someone was singing a song a deep glad voice was singing UNK and happily but it was singing nonsense hey dol merry dol ring a UNK dillo ring a UNK hop along UNK UNK the willow tom UNK jolly tom tom UNK half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger frodo and sam now both stood still suddenly out of a long string of UNK or so they seemed the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song hey come merry UNK  derry dol my UNK light goes the UNK and the UNK UNK down along under hill shining in the sunlight waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight there my pretty lady is UNK daughter slender as the UNK clearer than the water old tom bombadil water-lilies bringing comes UNK home again can you hear him singing hey come merry dol deny dol and UNK goldberry goldberry merry yellow UNK poor old willow-man you UNK your roots away toms in a hurry now evening will follow day toms going home again water-lilies bringing hey come derry dol can you hear me singing frodo and sam stood as if enchanted the wind puffed out the leaves hung silently again on stiff branches there was another burst of song and then suddenly UNK and dancing along the path there appeared above the reeds an old UNK hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in the UNK with another hop and a bound there came into view a man or so it seemed at any rate he was too large and heavy for a hobbit if not quite tall enough for one of the big people though he made noise enough for one UNK along with great yellow boots on his thick legs and UNK through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink he had a blue coat and a long brown beard his eyes were blue and bright and his face was red as a ripe apple but UNK into a hundred UNK of laughter in his hands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile of white water-lilies help cried frodo and sam running towards him with their hands stretched out whoa whoa steady there cried the old man holding up one hand and they stopped short as if they had been struck stiff now my little fellows where be you UNK to UNK like a UNK whats the matter here then do you know who i am im tom bombadil tell me whats your trouble toms in a hurry now dont you UNK my lilies my friends are caught in the UNK cried frodo UNK master merrys being UNK in a crack cried sam what shouted tom bombadil leaping up in the air old man willow naught worse than that eh that can soon be mended i know the tune for him old grey willow-man ill UNK his UNK cold if he dont UNK himself ill sing his roots off ill sing a wind up and blow leaf and branch away old man willow setting down his lilies carefully on the grass he ran to the tree there he saw merrys feet still UNK out - the rest had already been drawn further inside tom put his mouth to the crack and began singing into it in a low voice they could not catch the words but evidently merry was UNK his legs began to UNK tom sprang away and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of the willow with it you let them out again old man willow he said what be you UNK of you should not be waking eat earth dig deep drink water go to sleep bombadil is talking he then seized merrys feet and drew him out of the suddenly widening crack there was a UNK creak and the other crack UNK open and out of it pippin sprang as if he had been kicked then with a loud UNK both cracks closed fast again a UNK ran through the tree from root to UNK and complete silence fell thank you said the hobbits one after the other tom bombadil burst out laughing well my little fellows said he stooping so that he peered into their faces you shall come home with me the table is all laden with yellow UNK UNK and white bread and butter goldberry is waiting time enough for questions around the supper table you follow after me as quick as you are able with that he picked up his lilies and then with a UNK wave of his hand went UNK and dancing along the path eastward still singing loudly and UNK too surprised and too relieved to talk the hobbits followed after him as fast as they could but that was not fast enough tom soon disappeared in front of them and the noise of his singing got UNK and further away suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a loud UNK hop along my little friends up the withywindle toms going on ahead candles for to UNK down west UNK the sun soon you will be groping when the UNK fall then the door will open out of the UNK light will UNK yellow fear no UNK black heed no UNK willow fear neither root nor bough tom goes on before you hey now merry UNK well be waiting for you after that the hobbits heard no more almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the trees behind them they thought of the slanting light of evening glittering on the brandywine river and the windows of bucklebury beginning to gleam with hundreds of lights great shadows fell across them trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path white mists began to rise and UNK on the surface of the river and stray about the roots of the trees upon its borders out of the very ground at their feet a shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk it became difficult to follow the path and they were very tired their legs seemed UNK strange UNK noises ran among the bushes and reeds on either side of them and if they looked up to the pale sky they caught sight of queer gnarled and UNK faces that UNK dark against the twilight and UNK down at them from the high bank and the edges of the wood they began to feel that all this country was UNK and that they were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no UNK just as they felt their feet UNK down to a UNK they noticed that the ground was gently rising the water began to murmur in the darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam where the river flowed over a short fall then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left behind they stepped out from the forest and found a wide sweep of grass UNK up before them the river now small and swift was leaping merrily down to meet them glinting here and there in the light of the stars which were already shining in the sky the grass under their feet was smooth and short as if it had been UNK or shaven the eaves of the forest behind were UNK and UNK as a hedge the path was now plain before them well UNK and UNK with stone it wound up on to the top of a grassy UNK now grey under the pale starry night and there still high above them on a further slope they saw the twinkling lights of a house down again the path went and then up again up a long smooth hillside of turf towards the light suddenly a wide yellow UNK flowed out brightly from a door that was opened there was tom UNK house before them up down under hill behind it a steep shoulder of the land lay grey and bare and beyond that the dark shapes of the barrow-downs UNK away into the eastern night they all hurried forward hobbits and ponies already half their weariness and all their fears had fallen from them hey come merry dol rolled out the song to greet them hey come derry dol hop along my UNK hobbits ponies all we are fond of UNK now let the fun begin let us sing together then another clear voice as young and as ancient as spring like the song of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning in the hills came falling like silver to meet them now let the song begin let us sing together of sun stars moon and mist rain and UNK weather light on the UNK leaf dew on the feather wind on the open hill bells on the heather reeds by the UNK pool lilies on the water old tom bombadil and the river-daughter and with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold and a golden light was all about them chapter   in the house of tom bombadil the four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold and stood still UNK they were in a long low room filled with the light of lamps UNK from the UNK of the roof and on the table of dark polished wood stood many candles tall and yellow burning brightly in a chair at the far side of the room facing the outer door sat a UNK her long yellow hair UNK down her shoulders her UNK was green green as young reeds shot with silver like UNK of dew and her belt was of gold shaped like a chain of UNK set with the UNK eyes of UNK about her feel in wide UNK of green and brown UNK white water-lilies were floating so that she seemed to be UNK in the midst of a pool enter good guests she said and as she spoke they knew that it was her clear voice they had heard singing they came a few timid steps further into the room and began to bow low feeling strangely surprised and UNK like folk that knocking at a UNK door to beg for a drink of water have been answered by a fair young UNK clad in living flowers but before they could say anything she sprang lightly up and over the UNK UNK and ran laughing towards them and as she ran her UNK rustled softly like the wind in the UNK borders of a river come dear folk she said taking frodo by the hand UNK and be merry i am goldberry daughter of the river then lightly she passed them and closing the door she turned her back to it with her white arms spread out across it let us shut out the night she said for you are still afraid perhaps of mist and UNK and deep water and UNK things fear nothing for tonight you are under the roof of tom bombadil the hobbits looked at her in wonder and she looked at each of them and smiled fair lady goldberry said frodo at last feeling his heart moved with a joy that he did not understand he stood as he had at times stood enchanted by fair UNK UNK voices but the spell that was now laid upon him was different less keen and lofty was the delight but deeper and nearer to mortal heart marvellous and yet not strange fair lady goldberry he said again now the joy that was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to me o slender as a UNK o clearer than clear water  o UNK by the living pool fair river-daughter o UNK and UNK and spring again after o wind on the UNK and the leaves laughter suddenly he stopped and stammered overcome with surprise to hear himself saying such things but goldberry laughed welcome she said i had not heard that folk of the shire were so sweet UNK but i see you are an elf-friend the light in your eyes and the ring in your voice tells it this is a merry meeting sit now and wait for the master of the house he will not be long he is UNK your tired beasts the hobbits sat down gladly in low UNK chairs while goldberry UNK herself about the table and their eyes followed her for the slender UNK of her movement filled them with quiet delight from somewhere behind the house came the sound of singing every now and again they caught among many a derry dol and a merry dol and a ring a UNK dillo the repeated words old tom bombadil is a merry fellow bright blue his jacket is and his boots are yellow fair lady said frodo again after a while tell me if my asking does not seem foolish who is tom bombadil he is said goldberry staying her swift movements and smiling frodo looked at her UNK he is as you have seen him she said in answer to his look he is the master of wood water and hill then all this strange land belongs to him no indeed she answered and her smile faded that would indeed be a burden she added in a low voice as if to herself the trees and the grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to themselves tom bombadil is the master no one has ever caught old tom walking in the forest UNK in the water leaping on the hill-tops under light and shadow he has no fear tom bombadil is master a door opened and in came tom bombadil he had now no hat and his thick brown hair was crowned with autumn leaves he laughed and going to goldberry took her hand heres my pretty lady he said bowing to the hobbits heres my goldberry clothed all in silver UNK with flowers in her UNK is the table laden i see yellow UNK and UNK and white bread and butter UNK UNK and green herbs and ripe UNK gathered is that enough for us is the supper ready it is said goldberry but the guests perhaps are not tom clapped his hands and cried tom tom your guests are tired and you had near forgotten come now my merry friends and tom will UNK you you shall clean UNK hands and UNK your weary faces cast off your muddy cloaks and UNK out your UNK he opened the door and they followed him down a short passage and round a sharp turn they came to a low room with a sloping roof a UNK it seemed built on to the north end of the house its walls were of clean stone but they were mostly covered with green hanging UNK and yellow curtains the floor was UNK and UNK with fresh green rushes there were four deep UNK each piled with white blankets laid on the floor along one side against the UNK wall was a long UNK laden with wide UNK UNK and beside it stood brown UNK filled with water some cold some UNK hot there were soft green UNK set ready beside each bed before long washed and refreshed the hobbits were seated at the table two on each side while at either end sat goldberry and the master it was a long and merry meal though the hobbits ate as only UNK hobbits can eat there was no lack the drink in their drinking UNK seemed to be clear cold water yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free their voices the guests became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily as if it was easier and more natural than talking at last tom and goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly the guests were commanded to sit quiet and were set in chairs each with a UNK to his tired feet there was a fire in the wide hearth before them and it was burning with a sweet smell as if it were built of UNK when everything was set in order all the lights in the room were put out except one lamp and a pair of candles at each end of the UNK then goldberry came and stood before them holding a candle and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep have peace now she said until the morning heed no nightly noises for nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill-top good night she passed out of the room with a glimmer and a rustle the sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night tom sat on a while beside them in silence while each of them tried to UNK the courage to ask one of the many questions he had meant to ask at supper sleep gathered on their UNK at last frodo spoke did you hear me calling master or was it just chance that brought you at that moment tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream eh what said he did i hear you calling nay i did not hear i was busy singing just chance brought me then if chance you call it it was no plan of mine though i was waiting for you we heard news of you and learned that you were wandering we guessed youd come ere long down to the water all paths lead that way down to withywindle old grey willow-man hes a mighty UNK and its hard for little folk to escape his cunning UNK but tom had an errand there that he dared not hinder tom nodded as if sleep was taking him again but he went on in a soft singing voice i had an errand there gathering water-lilies green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady the last ere the years end to keep them from the winter to flower by her pretty feet UNK the UNK are melted each year at summers end i go to find them for her in a wide pool deep and clear far down withywindle there they open first in spring and there they UNK latest by that pool long ago i found the river-daughter fair young goldberry sitting in the rushes sweet was her singing then and her heart was beating he opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue and that proved well for you  for now i shall no longer go down deep again along the UNK not while the year is old nor shall i be passing old man willows house this side of UNK not till the merry spring when the river-daughter UNK down the UNK to bathe in the water he fell silent again but frodo could not help asking one more question the one he most desired to have answered tell us master he said about the willow-man what is he i have never heard of him before no dont said merry and pippin together sitting suddenly UNK not now not until the morning that is right said the old man now is the time for UNK some things are ill to hear when the UNK in shadow sleep till the morning UNK rest on the UNK  heed no nightly noise fear no grey willow and with that he took down the lamp and blew it out and UNK a candle in either hand he led them out of the room their UNK and UNK were soft as down and the blankets were of white UNK they had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn the light UNK over them before they were asleep in the dead night frodo lay in a dream without light then he saw the young moon rising under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall of rock pierced by a dark arch like a great gate it seemed to frodo that he was lifted up and passing over he saw that the UNK was a circle of hills and that within it was a plain and in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of stone like a vast tower but not made by hands on its top stood the figure of a man the moon as it rose seemed to UNK for a moment above his head and UNK in his white hair as the wind stirred it up from the dark plain below came the crying of fell voices and the howling of many wolves suddenly a shadow like the shape of great wings passed across the moon the figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that he UNK a mighty eagle swept down and bore him away the voices UNK and the wolves UNK there was a noise like a strong wind blowing and on it was borne the sound of hoofs galloping galloping galloping from the east black riders thought frodo as he UNK with the sound of the hoofs still echoing in his mind he wondered if he would ever again have the courage to leave the safety of these stone walls he lay UNK still listening but all was now silent and at last he turned and fell asleep again or wandered into some other UNK dream at his side pippin lay dreaming UNK but a change came over his dreams and he turned and UNK suddenly he woke or thought he had UNK and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream UNK UNK  the noise was like branches UNK in the wind UNK UNK wall and window creak creak creak he wondered if there were UNK close to the house and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all but inside the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again he sat up and felt the soft UNK yield to his hands and he lay down again relieved he seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears fear nothing have peace until the morning heed no nightly noises then he went to sleep again it was the sound of water that merry heard falling into his quiet sleep water streaming down gently and then spreading spreading UNK all round the house into a dark UNK pool it UNK under the walls and was rising slowly but surely i shall be drowned he thought it will find its way in and then i shall UNK he felt that he was lying in a soft slimy bog and springing up he set his fool on the corner of a cold hard UNK then he remembered where he was and lay down again he seemed to hear or remember hearing nothing passes doors or windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill-top a little breath of sweet air moved the UNK he breathed deep and fell asleep again as far as he could remember sam slept through the night in deep content if UNK are UNK they woke up all four at once in the morning light tom was moving about the room whistling like a UNK when he heard them stir he clapped his hands and cried hey come merry dol derry dol my UNK he drew back the yellow curtains and the hobbits saw that these had covered the windows at either end of the room one looking east and the other looking west they leapt up refreshed frodo ran to the eastern window and found himself looking into a UNK grey with dew he had half expected to see turf right up to the walls turf all UNK with UNK actually his view was UNK by a tall line of UNK on UNK but above and far beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise it was a pale morning in the east behind long clouds like lines of UNK UNK stained red at the edges lay glimmering deeps of yellow the sky spoke of rain to come but the light was UNK quickly and the red flowers on the UNK began to glow against the wet green leaves pippin looked out of the western window down into a pool of mist the forest was hidden under a fog it was like looking down on to a sloping UNK from above there was a fold or channel where the mist was broken into many plumes and UNK the valley of the withywindle the stream ran down the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows near at hand was a UNK and a UNK hedge silver UNK and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with UNK there was no UNK to be seen good morning merry friends cried tom opening the eastern window wide a cool air flowed in it had a UNK smell sun wont show her face much today im thinking i have been walking wide leaping on the UNK since the grey dawn began UNK wind and weather wet grass UNK wet sky above me i UNK goldberry singing under window but UNK UNK UNK in the early morning in the night little folk wake up in the darkness and sleep after light has come ring a UNK dillo wake now my merry friends forget the nightly noises ring a UNK dillo UNK derry UNK my UNK if you come soon youll find breakfast on the table if you come late youll get grass and UNK UNK to say - not that toms threat sounded very serious - the hobbits came soon and left the table late and only when it was beginning lo look rather empty neither tom nor goldberry were there tom could be heard about the house UNK in the kitchen and up and down the stairs and singing here and there outside the room looked westward over the UNK valley and the window was open water UNK down from the UNK eaves above before they had finished breakfast the clouds had joined into an unbroken roof and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down behind its deep UNK the forest was UNK veiled as they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was flowing down the rain out of the sky the clear voice of goldberry singing up above them they could hear few words but it seemed plain to them that the song was a UNK as sweet as UNK on dry hills that told the tale of a river from the spring in the UNK to the sea far below the hobbits listened with delight and frodo was glad in his heart and blessed the kindly weather because it delayed them from departing the thought of going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke but he guessed now that they would not go further that day the upper wind settled in the west and deeper and UNK clouds rolled up to UNK their laden rain on the bare heads of the downs nothing could be seen all round the house but falling water frodo stood near the open door and watched the white UNK path turn into a little river of UNK and go bubbling away down into the valley tom bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house waving his arms as if he was UNK off the rain - and indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry except for his boots these he took off and put in the UNK then he sat in the UNK chair and called the hobbits to gather round him this is UNK UNK day he said and her UNK too wet for UNK - let them rest while they are able its a good day for long tales for questions and for UNK so tom will start the talking he then told them many remarkable stories sometimes half as if speaking to himself sometimes looking at them suddenly with a bright blue eye under his deep brows often his voice would turn to song and he would get out of his chair and dance about he told them tales of UNK and flowers the ways of trees and the strange creatures of the forest about the evil things and good things things friendly and things unfriendly cruel things and kind things and secrets hidden under brambles as they listened they began to understand the lives of the forest apart from themselves indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all other things were at home moving constantly in and out of his talk was old man willow and frodo learned now enough to content him indeed more than enough for it was not comfortable lore toms words laid bare the hearts of trees and their thoughts which were often dark and strange and filled with a hatred of things that go free upon the earth UNK biting breaking UNK burning UNK and UNK it was not called the old forest without reason for it was indeed ancient a UNK of vast forgotten woods and in it there lived yet UNK no quicker than the hills the fathers of the fathers of trees remembering times when they were lords the countless years had filled them with UNK and rooted wisdom and with malice but none were more dangerous than the great willow his heart was UNK but his strength was green and he was cunning and a master of winds and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the river his grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like fine UNK in the ground and invisible UNK in the air till it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the forest from the hedge to the downs suddenly toms talk left the woods and went leaping up the young stream over bubbling UNK over UNK and worn rocks and among small flowers in close grass and wet UNK wandering at last up on to the downs they heard of the great barrows and the green mounds and the UNK upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills sheep were UNK in UNK green walls and white walls rose there were UNK on the heights kings of little UNK fought together and the young sun shone like fire on the red metal of their new and UNK swords there was victory and defeat and towers fell UNK were burned and flames went up into the sky gold was piled on the UNK of dead kings and UNK and mounds covered them and the stone doors were shut and the grass grew over all sheep walked for a while biting the grass but soon the hills were empty again a shadow came out of dark places far away and the bones were stirred in the mounds barrow- wights walked in the hollow places with a UNK of rings on cold fingers and gold chains in the wind stone rings UNK out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight the hobbits shuddered even in the shire the rumour of the barrow- wights of the barrow-downs beyond the forest had been heard but it was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to even by a comfortable fireside far away these four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this house had driven from their minds the house of tom bombadil UNK under the very shoulder of those dreaded hills they lost the UNK of his tale and UNK uneasily looking aside at one another when they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered into strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought into UNK when the world was wider and the seas flowed straight to the western shore and still on and back tom went singing out into ancient starlight when only the UNK were awake then suddenly he slopped and they saw that he nodded as if he was falling asleep the hobbits sat still before him enchanted and it seemed as if under the spell of his words the wind had gone and the clouds had UNK up and the day had been withdrawn and darkness had come from east and west and all the sky was filled with the light of white stars whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed frodo could not tell ele did not feel either hungry or tired only filled with wonder the stars shone through the window and the silence of the heavens seemed to be round him he spoke at last out of his wonder and a sudden fear of that silence who are you master he asked eh what said tom sitting up and his eyes glinting in the gloom dont you know my name yet thats the only answer tell me who are you alone yourself and nameless but you are young and i am old eldest thats what i am mark my words my friends tom was here before the river and the trees tom UNK the first UNK and the first UNK he made paths before the big people and saw the little people UNK he was here before the kings and the UNK and the barrow- wights when the elves passed westward tom was here already before the seas were bent he knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless - before the dark lord came from outside a shadow seemed to pass by the window and the hobbits glanced hastily through the UNK when they turned again goldberry stood in the door behind UNK in light she held a candle UNK its flame from the draught with her hand and the light flowed through it like sunlight through a white UNK the rain has ended she said and new waters are running downhill under the stars let us now laugh and be glad and let us have food and drink cried tom long tales are thirsty and long UNK hungry work morning noon and evening with that he jumped out of his chair and with a bound took a candle from the UNK and lit it in the flame that goldberry held then he danced about the table suddenly he UNK through the door and disappeared quickly he returned bearing a large and laden tray then tom and goldberry set the table and the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in laughter so fair was the UNK of goldberry and so merry and odd the UNK of tom yet in some fashion they seemed to UNK a single dance neither UNK the other in and out of the room and round about the table and with great speed food and UNK and lights were set in order the UNK UNK with candles white and yellow tom bowed to his guests supper is ready said goldberry and now the hobbits saw that she was clothed all in silver with a white UNK and her shoes were like UNK mail but tom was all in clean blue blue as UNK UNK and he had green UNK it was a supper even better than before the hobbits under the spell of toms words may have missed one meal or many but when the food was before them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten they did not sing or even speak much for a while and paid close attention to business but after a time their hearts and spirit rose high again and their voices rang out in UNK and laughter after they had eaten goldberry sang many songs for them songs that began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence and in the UNK they saw in their minds pools and waters wider than any they had known and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like jewels in the depths then once more she wished them each good night and left them by the fireside but tom now seemed wide awake and UNK them with questions he appeared already to know much about them and all their families and indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the shire down from days hardly remembered among the hobbits themselves it no longer surprised them but he made no secret that he UNK his recent knowledge largely to farmer maggot whom he seemed to UNK as a person of more importance than they had imagined theres earth under his old feet and UNK on his fingers wisdom in his bones and both his eyes are open said tom it was also clear that tom had dealings with the elves and it seemed that in some fashion news had reached him from gildor concerning the flight of frodo indeed so much did tom know and so cunning was his UNK that frodo found himself telling him more about bilbo and his own UNK and fears than he had told before even to gandalf tom UNK his head up and down and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the riders show me the precious ring he said suddenly in the midst of the story and frodo to his own astonishment drew out the chain from his pocket and UNK the ring handed it at once to tom it seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big UNK hand then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed for a second the hobbits had a vision both UNK and UNK of his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold then tom put the ring round the end of his little finger and held it up to the UNK for a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this then they gasped there was no sign of tom disappearing tom laughed again and then he UNK the ring in the air - and it vanished with a flash frodo gave a cry - and tom leaned forward and handed it back to him with a smile frodo looked at it closely and rather suspiciously like one who has UNK a UNK to a UNK it was the same ring or looked the same and weighed the same for that ring had always seemed to frodo to UNK strangely heavy in the hand but something UNK him to make sure he was perhaps a UNK annoyed with tom for seeming to make so light of what even gandalf thought so UNK important he waited for an UNK when the talk was going again and tom was telling an absurd story about UNK and their queer ways - then he slipped the ring on merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start and UNK an UNK frodo was delighted in a way it was his own ring all right for merry was staring UNK at his chair and obviously could not see him he got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the outer door hey there cried tom glancing towards him with a most seeing look in his shining eyes hey come frodo there where be you UNK old tom UNK not as blind as that yet take off your golden ring your hands more fair without it come back leave your game and sit down beside me we must talk a while more and think about the morning tom must UNK the right road and keep your feet from wandering frodo laughed trying to feel pleased and taking off the ring he came and sat down again tom now told them that he reckoned the sun would shine tomorrow and it would be a glad morning and setting out would be hopeful but they would do well to start early for weather in that country was a thing that even tom could not be sure of for long and it would change sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket i am no UNK he said nor is UNK that goes on two legs by his advice they decided to make nearly due north from his house over the western and lower slopes of the downs they might hope in that way to strike the east road in a days journey and avoid the barrows he told them not to be afraid - but to mind their own business keep to the green grass dont you go UNK with old stone or cold wights or UNK in their houses unless you be strong folk with hearts that never falter he said this more than once and he UNK them to pass barrows by on the UNK if they UNK to stray near one then he taught them a UNK to sing if they should by UNK fall into any danger or difficulty the next day ho tom bombadil tom UNK by water wood and hill by the UNK and willow by fire sun and moon UNK now and hear us come tom bombadil for our need is near us when they had sung this altogether after him he clapped them each on the shoulder with a laugh and taking candles led them back to their UNK chapter   fog on the barrow-downs that night they heard no noises but either in his dreams or out of them he could not tell which frodo heard a sweet singing running in his mind a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey UNK and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver until at last it was rolled back and a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrise the vision melted into waking and there was tom whistling like a UNK of birds and the sun was already slanting down the hill and through the open window outside everything was green and pale gold after breakfast which they again ate alone they made ready to say farewell as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning cool bright and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue the air came fresh from the UNK their quiet ponies were almost UNK sniffing and moving UNK tom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced upon the doorstep bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good speed they rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house and went slanting up towards the north end of the hill UNK under which it sheltered they had just UNK to lead their ponies up the last steep slope when suddenly frodo stopped goldberry he cried my fair lady clad all in silver green we have never said farewell to her nor seen her since the evening he was so UNK that he turned back but at that moment a clear call came rippling down there on the UNK she stood UNK to them her hair was flying loose and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered a light like the glint of water on UNK grass flashed from under her feet as she danced they hastened up the last slope and stood breathless beside her they bowed but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round and they looked out from the hill-top over lands under the morning it was now as clear and UNK as it had been veiled and misty when they stood upon the UNK in the forest which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark trees in the west in that direction the land rose in wooded ridges green yellow UNK under the sun beyond which lay hidden the valley of the brandywine to the south over the line of the withywindle there was a distant glint like pale glass where the brandywine river made a great loop in the UNK and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits northward beyond the UNK downs the land ran away in flats and UNK of grey and green and pale earth UNK until it faded into a UNK and shadowy distance eastward the barrow-downs rose ridge behind ridge into the morning and vanished out of UNK into a guess it was no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer UNK with the UNK of the sky but it spoke to them out of memory and old tales of the high and distant mountains they took a deep draught of the air and felt that a UNK and a few stout UNK would bear them wherever they wished it seemed UNK to go jogging aside over the UNK skirts of the downs towards the road when they should be leaping as UNK as tom over the UNK stones of the hills straight towards the mountains goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts speed now fair guests she said and hold to your purpose north with the wind in the left eye and a UNK on your footsteps make haste while the sun UNK and to frodo she said farewell elf-friend it was a merry meeting but frodo found no words to answer he bowed low and mounted his pony and followed by his friends UNK slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill tom UNK house and the valley and the forest were lost to view the air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside and the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed turning back when they reached the bottom of the green hollow they saw goldberry now small and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky she was standing still watching them and her hands were stretched out towards them as they looked she gave a clear call and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hill  their way wound along the floor of the hollow and round the green feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley and then over the shoulder of further hills and down their long limbs and up their smooth sides again up on to new hill-tops and down into new valleys there was no tree nor any visible water it was a country of grass and short UNK turf silent except for the whisper of the air over the edges of the land and high lonely cries of strange birds as they journeyed the sun mounted and grew hot each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less when they caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant forest seemed to be smoking as if the fallen rain was UNK up again from leaf and root and UNK a shadow now lay round the edge of sight a dark haze above which the upper sky was like a blue UNK hot and heavy about mid-day they came to a hill whose top was wide and UNK like a shallow UNK with a green UNK rim inside there was no air UNK and the sky seemed near their heads they rode across and looked northwards then their hearts rose for it seemed plain that they had come further already than they had expected certainly the UNK had now all become UNK and UNK but there could be no doubt that the downs were coming to an end a long valley lay below them winding away northwards until it came to an opening between two steep shoulders beyond there seemed to be no more hills due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line that is a line of trees said merry and that must mark the road all along it for many leagues east of the bridge there are trees growing some say they were planted in the old days splendid said frodo if we make as good going this afternoon as we have done this morning we shall have left the downs before the sun UNK and be jogging on in search of a UNK place but even as he spoke he turned his glance eastwards and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and looked down upon them and all those hills were crowned with green mounds and on some were standing stones pointing upwards like UNK teeth out of green UNK that view was somehow UNK so they turned from the sight and went down into the hollow circle in the midst of it there stood a single stone standing tall under the sun above and at this hour UNK no shadow it was shapeless and yet UNK like a UNK or a UNK finger or more like a warning but they were now hungry and the sun was still at the fearless noon so they set their backs against the east side of the stone it was cool as if the sun had had no power to warm it but at that time this seemed pleasant there they took food and drink and made as good a UNK under the open sky as anyone could wish for the food came from down under hill tom had UNK them with plenty for the comfort of the day their ponies UNK strayed upon the grass riding over the hills and eating their fill the warm sun and the scent of turf lying a little too long stretching out their legs and looking at the sky above their noses these things are perhaps enough to explain what happened however that may be they woke suddenly and UNK from a sleep they had never meant to take the standing stone was cold and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them the sun a pale and UNK yellow was gleaming through the mist just above the west wall of the hollow in which they lay north south and east beyond the wall the fog was thick cold and white the air was silent heavy and chill their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads down the hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm and ran to the western rim they found that they were upon an island in the fog even as they looked out in dismay towards the setting sun it sank before their eyes into a white sea and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the east behind the fog rolled up to the walls and rose above them and as it mounted it bent over their heads until it became a roof they were shut in a hall of mist whose UNK pillar was the standing stone they felt as if a UNK was closing about them but they did not quite lose heart they still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line of the road ahead and they still knew in which direction it lay in any case they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone that no thought of remaining there was in their minds they packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would work soon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and down the long northward slope of the hill down into a foggy sea as they went down the mist became UNK and UNK and their hair hung UNK and dripping on their UNK when they reached the bottom it was so cold that they halted and got out cloaks and UNK which soon became UNK with grey UNK then mounting their ponies they went slowly on again feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground they were UNK as well as they could guess for the UNK opening at the far northward end of the long valley which they had seen in the morning once they were through the gap they had only lo keep on in anything like a straight line and they were bound in the end to strike the road their thoughts did not go beyond that except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the downs there might be no fog their going was very slow to prevent their getting UNK and wandering in different UNK they went in file with frodo leading sam was behind him and after him came pippin and then merry the valley seemed to UNK on endlessly suddenly frodo saw a hopeful sign on either side ahead a darkness began to UNK through the mist and he guessed that they were at last approaching the gap in the hills the north-gate of the barrow-downs if they could pass that they would be free come on follow me he called back over his shoulder and he hurried forward but his hope soon changed to UNK and alarm the dark patches grew darker but they shrank and suddenly he saw towering ominous before him and leaning UNK towards one another like the pillars of a UNK door two huge standing stones he could not remember having seen any sign of these in the valley when he looked out from the hill in the morning he had passed between them almost before he was aware and even as he did so darkness seemed to fall round him his pony reared and snorted and he fell off when he looked back he found that he was alone the others had not followed him sam he called pippin merry come along why dont you keep up there was no answer fear took him and he ran back past the stones shouting wildly sam sam merry pippin the pony bolted into the mist and vanished from some way off or so it seemed he thought he heard a cry hoy frodo hoy it was away eastward on his left as he stood under the great stones staring and UNK into the gloom he plunged off in the direction of the call and found himself going steeply UNK as he struggled on he called again and kept on calling more and more UNK but he heard no answer for some time and then it seemed faint and far ahead and high above him frodo hoy came the thin voices out of the mist and then a cry that sounded like help help often repeated ending with a last help that trailed off into a long UNK suddenly cut short he stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the cries but the light was now gone and UNK night had closed about him so that it was impossible to be sure of any direction he seemed all the time to be climbing up and up only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he at last came to the top of a ridge or hill he was weary UNK and yet chilled it was wholly dark where are you he cried out UNK there was no reply he stood listening he was suddenly aware that it was getting very cold and that up here a wind was beginning to blow an icy wind a change was coming in the weather the mist was flowing past him now in UNK and UNK his breath was smoking and the darkness was less near and thick he looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were UNK overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog the wind began to hiss over the grass he imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry and he made towards it and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside and the starry sky was UNK a glance showed him that he was now facing southwards and was on a round hill-top which he must have climbed from the north out of the east the biting wind was blowing to his right there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape a great barrow stood there where are you he cried again both angry and afraid here said a voice deep and cold that seemed to come out of the ground i am waiting for you no said frodo but he did not run away his knees gave and he fell on the ground nothing happened and there was no sound trembling he looked up in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the stars it leaned over him he thought there were two eyes very cold though lit with a pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance then a grip stronger and UNK than iron seized him the icy touch UNK his bones and he remembered no more when he came to himself again for a moment he could recall nothing except a sense of dread then suddenly he knew that he was UNK caught UNK he was in a barrow a UNK had taken him and he was probably already under the dreadful UNK of the barrow- wights about which whispered tales spoke he dared not move but lay as he found himself flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast but though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very darkness that was round him he found himself as he lay thinking about bilbo baggins and his stories of their jogging along together in the UNK of the shire and talking about roads and adventures there is a UNK of courage hidden often deeply it is true in the heart of the UNK and most timid hobbit wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow frodo was neither very fat nor very timid indeed though he did not know it bilbo and gandalf had thought him the best hobbit in the shire he thought he had come to the end of his adventure and a terrible end but the thought UNK him he found himself UNK as if for a final spring he no longer felt UNK like a UNK UNK as he lay there thinking and getting a hold of himself he noticed all at once that the darkness was slowly giving way a pale UNK light was growing round him it did not at first show him what kind of a place he was in for the light seemed to be coming out of himself and from the floor beside him and had not yet reached the roof or wall he turned and there in the cold glow he saw lying beside him sam pippin and merry they were on their backs and their faces looked UNK pale and they were clad in white about them lay many treasures of gold maybe though in that light they looked cold and UNK on their heads were UNK gold chains were about their UNK and on their fingers were many rings swords lay by their sides and UNK were at their feet but across their three necks lay one long naked sword suddenly a song began a cold murmur rising and falling the voice seemed far away and UNK dreary sometimes high in the air and thin sometimes like a low UNK from the ground out of the UNK stream of sad but horrible sounds UNK of words would now and again shape themselves grim hard cold words UNK and miserable the night was UNK against the morning of which it was UNK and the cold was cursing the UNK for which it UNK frodo was chilled to the UNK after a while the song became clearer and with dread in his heart he perceived that it had changed into an UNK cold be hand and heart and bone and cold be sleep under stone never UNK to wake on stony bed never till the sun fails and the moon is dead in the black wind the stars shall die and still on gold here let them lie till the dark lord UNK his hand over dead sea and withered land he heard behind his head a creaking and UNK sound UNK himself on one arm he looked and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind of passage which behind them turned a corner round the corner a long arm was groping walking on its fingers towards sam who was lying nearest and towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him at first frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the UNK then a wild thought of escape came to him he wondered if he put on the ring whether the UNK would miss him and he might find some way out he thought of himself running free over the grass UNK for merry and sam and pippin but free and alive himself gandalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do but the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong he could not leave his friends so easily he UNK groping in his pocket and then fought with himself again and as he did so the arm crept nearer suddenly UNK UNK in him and he seized a short sword that lay beside him and UNK he stooped low over the bodies of his companions with what strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the UNK and the hand broke off but at the same moment the sword UNK up to the hilt there was a UNK and the light vanished in the dark there was a UNK noise frodo fell forward over merry and merrys face felt cold all at once back into his mind from which it had disappeared with the first coming of the fog came the memory of the house down under the hill and of tom singing he remembered the UNK that tom had taught them in a small desperate voice he began ho tom bombadil and with that name his voice seemed to grow strong it had a full and UNK sound and the dark chamber UNK as if to UNK and UNK ho tom bombadil tom UNK by water wood and hill by the UNK and willow by fire sun and moon UNK now and hear us come tom bombadil for our need is near us there was a sudden deep silence in which frodo could hear his heart beating after a long slow moment he heard plain but far away as if it was coming down through the ground or through thick walls an answering voice singing old tom bombadil is a merry fellow bright blue his jacket is and his boots are yellow none has ever caught him yet for tom he is the master his songs are stronger songs and his feet are faster there was a loud UNK sound as of stones rolling and falling and suddenly light streamed in real light the plain light of day a low door UNK opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyond frodos feet and there was toms head hat feather and all UNK against the light of the sun rising red behind him the light fell upon the floor and upon the faces of the three hobbits lying beside frodo they did not stir but the UNK hue had left them they looked now as if they were only very deeply asleep tom stooped removed his hat and came into the dark chamber singing get out you old UNK vanish in the sunlight UNK like the cold mist like the winds go wailing out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains come never here again leave your barrow empty lost and forgotten be darker than the darkness where gates stand for ever shut till the world is mended at these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber fell in with a crash then there was a long UNK UNK fading away into an UNK distance and after that silence come friend frodo said tom let us get out on to clean grass you must help me bear them together they carried out merry pippin and sam as frodo left the barrow for the last time he thought he saw a UNK hand UNK still like a UNK UNK in a UNK of fallen earth tom went back in again and there was a sound of much UNK and UNK when he came out he was bearing in his arms a great UNK of treasure things of gold silver UNK and UNK many UNK and chains and UNK UNK he climbed the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine there he stood with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair and looked down upon the three hobbits that had been laid on their backs upon the grass at the west side of the mound UNK his right hand he said in a clear and commanding voice wake now my merry UNK wake and hear me calling warm now be heart and UNK the cold stone is fallen dark door is standing wide dead hand is broken night under night is UNK and the gate is open to frodos great joy the hobbits stirred stretched their arms rubbed their eyes and then suddenly sprang up they looked about in amazement first at frodo and then at tom standing large as life on the UNK above them and then at themselves in their thin white UNK crowned and UNK with pale gold and UNK with UNK what in the name of wonder began merry feeling the golden circlet that had slipped over one eye then he stopped and a shadow came over his face and he closed his eyes of course i remember he said the men of UNK UNK came on us at night and we were UNK ah the spear in my heart he clutched at his breast no no he said opening his eyes what am i saying i have been dreaming where did you get to frodo i thought that i was lost said frodo but i dont want to speak of it let us think of what we are to do now let us go on dressed up like this sir said sam where are my clothes he flung his circlet belt and rings on the grass and looked round UNK as if he expected to find his cloak jacket and UNK and other UNK lying somewhere to hand you wont find your clothes again said tom UNK down from the mound and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight one would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened and indeed the horror faded out of their hearts as they looked at him and saw the merry glint in his eyes what do you mean asked pippin looking at him half puzzled and half UNK why not but tom shook his head saying youve found yourselves again out of the deep water clothes are but little loss if you escape from UNK be glad my merry friends and let the warm sunlight heal now heart and UNK cast off these cold UNK run naked on the grass while tom goes UNK he sprang away down hill whistling and calling looking down after him frodo saw him running away southwards along the green hollow between their hill and the next still whistling and crying hey now come hoy now whither do you wander up down near or far here there or yonder UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK my little lad and old fatty lumpkin so he sang running fast tossing up his hat and catching it until he was hidden by a fold of the ground but for some time his hey now hoy now came floating back down the wind which had UNK round towards the south the air was growing very warm again the hobbits ran about for a while on the grass as he told them then they lay UNK in the sun with the delight of those that have been UNK suddenly from bitter winter to a friendly UNK or of people that after being long ill and UNK wake one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of promise by the time that tom returned they were feeling strong and hungry he reappeared hat first over the brow of the hill and behind him came in an UNK line six ponies their own five and one more the last was plainly old fatty lumpkin he was larger stronger UNK and older than their own ponies merry to whom the others belonged had not in fact given them any such names but they answered to the new names that tom had given them for the rest of their lives tom called them one by one and they climbed over the brow and stood in a line then tom bowed to the hobbits here are your ponies now he said theyve more sense in some ways than you wandering hobbits have - more sense in their noses for they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into and if they run to save themselves then they run the right way you must forgive them all for though their hearts are faithful to face fear of barrow- wights is not what they were made for see here they come again bringing all their burdens merry sam and pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from their packs and they soon felt too hot for they were obliged to put on some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the UNK of winter where does that other old animal that fatty lumpkin come from asked frodo hes mine said tom my UNK friend though i seldom ride him and he UNK often far free upon the UNK when your ponies stayed with me they got to know my lumpkin and they UNK him in the night and quickly ran to meet him i thought hed look for them and with his words of wisdom take all their fear away but now my jolly lumpkin old toms going to ride hey hes coming with you just to set you on the road so he needs a pony for you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding when youre on your own legs trying to UNK beside them the hobbits were delighted to hear this and UNK tom many times but he laughed and said that they were so good at UNK themselves that he would not feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his land UNK got things to do he said my making and my singing my talking and my walking and my watching of the country tom cant be always near to open doors and UNK tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting it was still fairly early by the sun something between nine and ten and the hobbits turned their minds to food their last meal had been lunch beside the standing stone the day before they UNK now off the remainder of toms UNK meant for their supper with UNK that tom had brought with him it was not a large meal considering hobbits and the UNK but they felt much better for it while they were eating tom went up to the mound and looked through the treasures most of these he made into a pile that UNK and UNK on the grass he bade them lie there free to all UNK birds beasts elves or men and all kindly creatures for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and no UNK ever come back to it he chose for himself from the pile a brooch set with blue stones UNK like UNK or the wings of blue UNK he looked long at it as if stirred by some memory shaking his head and saying at last here is a pretty UNK for tom and for his lady fair was she who long ago wore this on her shoulder goldberry shall wear it now and we will not forget her for each of the hobbits he chose a UNK long UNK and keen of marvellous UNK UNK with UNK in red and gold they gleamed as he drew them from their black UNK wrought of some strange metal light and strong and set with many fiery stones whether by some virtue in these UNK or because of the spell that lay on the mound the blades seemed UNK by time UNK sharp glittering in the sun old knives are long enough as swords for UNK he said sharp blades are good to have if shire-folk go walking east south or far away into dark and danger then he told them that these blades were forged many long years ago by men of westernesse they were foes of the dark lord but they were overcome by the evil king of UNK UNK in the land of angmar few now remember them tom murmured yet still some go wandering sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness UNK from evil things folk that are UNK the hobbits did not understand his words but as he spoke they had a vision as it were of a great UNK of years behind them like a vast shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of men tall and grim with bright swords and last came one with a star on his brow then the vision faded and they were back in the sunlit world it was time to start again they made ready packing their bags and UNK their ponies their new weapons they hung on their leather UNK under their UNK feeling them very UNK and wondering if they would be of any use UNK had not before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their flight would land them at last they set off they led their ponies down the hill and then mounting they trotted quickly along the valley they looked back and saw the top of the old mound on the hill and from it the sunlight on the gold went up like a yellow flame then they turned a shoulder of the downs and it was hidden from view though frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great stones standing like a gate and before long they came to the northern gap and rode swiftly through and the land fell away before them it was a merry journey with tom bombadil trotting UNK beside them or before them on fatty lumpkin who could move much faster than his UNK promised tom sang most of the time but it was chiefly nonsense or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight they went forward steadily but they soon saw that the road was further away than they had imagined even without a fog their sleep at mid-day would have prevented them from UNK it until after nightfall on the day before the dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line of bushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further side tom said that it had once been the UNK of a kingdom but a very long UNK ago he seemed to remember something sad about it and would not say much they climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall and then tom turned due north for they had been bearing somewhat to the west the land was now open and fairly level and they UNK their pace but the sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall trees ahead and they knew that they had come back to the road after many unexpected adventures they galloped their ponies over the last UNK and halted under the long shadows of the trees they were on the top of a sloping bank and the road now dim as evening drew on wound away below them at this point it ran nearly from south-west to UNK and on their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow it was UNK and bore many signs of the recent heavy rain there were pools and UNK full of water they rode down the bank and looked up and down there was nothing to be seen well here we are again at last said frodo i suppose we havent lost more than two days by my short cut through the forest but perhaps the delay will prove useful - it may have put them off our trail the others looked at him the shadow of the fear of the black riders came suddenly over them again ever since they had entered the forest they had thought chiefly of getting back to the road only now when it lay beneath their feet did they remember the danger which pursued them and was more than likely to be lying in wait for them upon the road itself they looked anxiously back towards the setting sun but the road was brown and empty do you think asked pippin UNK do you think we may be pursued tonight no i hope not tonight answered tom bombadil nor perhaps the next day but do not trust my guess for i cannot tell for certain out east my knowledge fails tom is not master of riders from the black land far beyond his country all the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them they felt that he would know how to deal with black riders if anyone did they would soon now be going forward into lands wholly strange to them and beyond all but the most vague and distant legends of the shire and in the gathering twilight they longed for home a deep loneliness and sense of loss was on them they stood silent reluctant to make the final parting and only slowly became aware that tom was UNK them farewell and telling them to have good heart and to ride on till dark without UNK tom will give you good advice till this day is over after that your own luck must go with you and guide you four miles along the road youll come upon a village bree under bree-hill with doors looking westward there youll find an old inn that is called the prancing pony barliman butterbur is the worthy keeper there you can stay the night and afterwards the morning will speed you upon your way be bold but wary keep up your merry hearts and ride to meet your fortune they begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more with them but he laughed and refused saying toms country ends here he will not pass the borders tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting then he turned tossed up his hat leaped on UNK back and rode up over the bank and away singing into the dusk the hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight i am sorry to take leave of master bombadil said sam hes a UNK and no mistake i reckon we may go a good deal further and see naught better nor UNK but i wont deny ill be glad to see this prancing pony he spoke of i hope UNK be like the green dragon away back home what sort of folk are they in bree there are hobbits in bree said merry as well as big folk i daresay it will be homelike enough the pony is a good inn by all accounts my people ride out there now and again it may be all we could wish said frodo but it is outside the shire all the same dont make yourselves too much at home  please remember UNK of you - that the name of baggins must not be mentioned i am mr underhill if any name must be given they now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the evening darkness came down quickly as they plodded slowly downhill and up again until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead before them rose bree-hill UNK the way a dark UNK against misty stars and under its western UNK UNK a large village towards it they now hurried UNK only to find a fire and a door between them and the night chapter   at the sign of the prancing pony bree was the chief village of the bree-land a small inhabited region like an island in the empty lands round about besides bree itself there was staddle on the other side of the hill UNK in a deep valley a little further eastward and archet on the edge of the chetwood lying round bree-hill and the villages was a small country of fields and UNK woodland only a few miles broad the men of bree were UNK broad and rather short cheerful and UNK they belonged to nobody but themselves but they were more friendly and familiar with hobbits dwarves elves and other inhabitants of the world about them than was or is usual with big people according to their own tales they were the original inhabitants and were the UNK of the first men that ever wandered into the west of the UNK few had survived the UNK of the elder days but when the kings returned again over the great sea they had found the UNK still there and they were still there now when the memory of the old kings had faded into the grass in those days no other men had settled dwellings so far west or within a hundred leagues of the shire but in the wild lands beyond bree there were mysterious wanderers the bree-folk called them rangers and knew nothing of their origin they were taller and darker than the men of bree and were believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing and to understand the languages of beasts and birds they UNK at will southwards and eastwards even as far as the misty mountains but they were now few and UNK seen when they appeared they brought news from afar and told strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to but the bree-folk did not make friends of them there were also many families of hobbits in the bree-land and they UNK to be the oldest UNK of hobbits in the world one that was founded long before even the brandywine was crossed and the shire UNK they lived mostly in staddle though there were some in bree itself especially on the higher slopes of the hill above the houses of the men the big folk and the little folk as they called one another were on friendly UNK UNK their own affairs in their own ways but both rightly UNK themselves as necessary parts of the bree-folk nowhere else in the world was this peculiar but excellent UNK to be found the bree-folk big and little did not themselves travel much and the affairs of the four villages were their chief concern occasionally the hobbits of bree went as far as buckland or the eastfarthing but though their UNK land was not much further than a days riding east of the brandywine bridge the hobbits of the shire now seldom visited it an UNK UNK or UNK took would come out to the inn for a night or two but even that was becoming less and less usual the shire-hobbits UNK to those of bree and to any others that lived beyond the borders as outsiders and took very little interest in them considering them dull and UNK there were probably many more outsiders scattered about in the west of the world in those days than the people of the shire imagined some doubtless were no better than UNK ready to dig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it UNK them but in the bree-land at any rate the hobbits were UNK and UNK and no more UNK than most of their distant relatives inside it was not yet forgotten that there had been a time when there was much coming and going between the shire and bree there was UNK in the brandybucks by all accounts the village of bree had some hundred stone houses of the big folk mostly above the road UNK on the hillside with windows looking west on that side running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to it there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side over this the road crossed by a causeway but where it pierced the hedge it was barred by a great gate there was another gate in the southern comer where the road ran out of the village the gates were closed at nightfall but just inside them were small UNK for the UNK down on the road where it swept to the right to go round the foot of the hill there was a large inn it had been built long ago when the traffic on the roads had been far greater for bree stood at an old meeting of ways another ancient road crossed the east road just outside he dike at the western end of the village and in former days men and other folk of various sorts had travelled much on it strange as news from bree was still a saying in the eastfarthing UNK from those days when news from north south and east could be heard in the inn and when the shire-hobbits used to go more often to hear it but the northern lands had long been desolate and the north road was now seldom used it was UNK and the bree-folk called it the greenway the inn of bree was still there however and the innkeeper was an important person his house was a meeting place for the idle UNK and inquisitive among the inhabitants large and small of the four villages and a UNK of rangers and other wanderers and for such travellers mostly dwarves as still journeyed on the east road to and from the mountains it was dark and white stars were shining when frodo and his companions came at last to the UNK and drew near the village they came to the UNK and found it shut but at the door of the UNK beyond it there was a man sitting he jumped up and UNK a lantern and looked over the gate at them in surprise what do you want and where do you come from he asked UNK we are making for the inn here answered frodo we are journeying east and cannot go further tonight hobbits  four hobbits  and whats more out of the shire by their talk said the gatekeeper softly as if speaking to himself he stared at them darkly for a moment and then slowly opened the gate and let them ride through we dont often see shire-folk riding on the road at night he went on as they halted a moment by his door youll pardon my wondering what business takes you away east of bree what may your names be might i ask our names and our business are our own and this does not seem a good place to UNK them said frodo not liking the look of the man or the tone of his voice your business is your own no doubt said the man but its my business to ask questions after nightfall we are hobbits from buckland and we have a fancy to travel and to stay at the inn here put in merry i am mr brandybuck is that enough for you the bree-folk used to be UNK to travellers or so i had heard all right all right said the man i meant no UNK but youll find maybe that more folk than old UNK at the gate will be asking you questions theres queer folk about if you go on to the pony youll find youre UNK the only guests he wished them good night and they said no more but frodo could see in the UNK that the man was still UNK them curiously he was glad to hear the gate UNK to behind them as they rode forward he wondered why the man was so suspicious and whether any one had been asking for news of a party of hobbits could it have been gandalf he might have arrived while they were delayed in the forest and the downs but there was something in the look and the voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy the man stared after the hobbits for a moment and then he went back to his house as soon as his back was turned a dark figure climbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the shadows of the village UNK the hobbits rode on up a gentle slope passing a few UNK houses and drew up outside the inn the houses looked large and strange to them sam stared up at the inn with its three UNK and many windows and felt his heart sink he had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees and other creatures even more UNK some time or other in the course of his journey but at the moment he was finding his first sight of men and their tall houses quite enough indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring day he UNK black horses standing all UNK in the shadows of the UNK and black riders peering out of dark upper windows we surely arent going to stay here for the night are we sir he exclaimed if there are UNK in these UNK why dont we look for some that would be willing to take us in it would be more homelike whats wrong with the inn said frodo tom bombadil UNK it i expect its homelike enough inside even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes it had a front on the road and two wings running back on land partly cut out of the lower slopes of the hill so that at the rear the UNK windows were level with the ground there was a wide arch leading to a UNK between the two wings and on the left under the arch there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps the door was open and light streamed out of it above the arch there was a lamp and beneath it swung a large UNK a fat white pony reared up on its UNK legs over the door was UNK in white letters the prancing pony by barliman butterbur many of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains as they hesitated outside in the gloom someone began singing a merry song inside and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus they listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their ponies the song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping they led their ponies under the arch and leaving them standing in the yard they climbed up the steps frodo went forward and nearly UNK into a short fat man with a UNK head and a red face he had a white UNK on and was UNK out of one door and in through another carrying a tray laden with full mugs can we began frodo half a minute if you please shouted the man over his shoulder and vanished into a UNK of voices and a cloud of smoke in a moment he was out again UNK his hands on his UNK good evening little master he said bending down what may you be wanting beds for four and UNK for five ponies if that can be managed are you mr butterbur thats right barliman is my name barliman butterbur at your service youre from the shire eh he said and then suddenly he clapped his hand to his UNK as if trying to remember something hobbits he cried now what does that UNK me of might i ask your names sir mr took and mr brandybuck said frodo and this is sam gamgee my name is underhill there now said mr butterbur UNK his fingers its gone again but UNK come back when i have time to think im run off my feet but ill see what i can do for you we dont often get a party out of the shire UNK and i should be sorry not to make you welcome but there is such a crowd already in the house tonight as there hasnt been for long enough it never UNK but it UNK we say in bree UNK nob he shouted where are you you UNK UNK UNK nob coming sir coming a UNK hobbit UNK out of a door and seeing the travellers stopped short and stared at them with great interest wheres bob asked the landlord you dont know well find him double sharp i havent got six legs nor six eyes neither tell bob theres five ponies that have to be UNK he must find room somehow nob trotted off with a UNK and a UNK well now what was i going to say said mr butterbur tapping his UNK one thing UNK out another so to speak im that busy tonight my head is going round theres a party that came up the greenway from down south last night - and that was strange enough to begin with then theres a UNK company of dwarves going west come in this evening and now theres you if you UNK hobbits i doubt if we could house you but UNK got a room or two in the north UNK that were made special for hobbits when this place was built on the ground floor as they usually UNK round windows and all as they like it i hope youll be comfortable youll be wanting supper i dont doubt as soon as may be this way now he led them a short way down a passage and opened a door here is a nice little UNK he said i hope it will UNK UNK me now im that busy no time for talking i must be trotting its hard work for two legs but i dont get thinner ill look in again later if you want anything ring the UNK and nob will come if he dont come ring and shout off he went at last and left them feeling rather breathless he seemed UNK of an endless stream of talk however busy he might be they found themselves in a small and UNK room there was a bit of bright fire burning on the hearth and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs there was a round table already spread with a white cloth and on it was a large UNK but nob the hobbit servant came UNK in long before they thought of ringing he brought candles and a tray full of UNK will you be wanting anything to drink masters he asked and shall i show you the UNK while your supper is got ready they were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when mr butterbur and nob came in again in a twinkling the table was laid there was hot UNK cold UNK a UNK UNK new UNK UNK of butter and half a ripe UNK good plain food as good as the shire could show and homelike enough to UNK the last of sams UNK already much relieved by the UNK of the beer the landlord UNK round for a UNK and then prepared to leave them i dont know whether you would care to join the company when you have UNK he said standing at the door perhaps you would rather go to your beds still the company would be very pleased to welcome you if you had a mind we dont get outsiders - travellers from the shire i should say begging your pardon - often and we like to hear a bit of news or any story or song you may have in mind but as you please ring the bell if you lack anything so refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper about three UNK of an hours steady going not hindered by UNK talk that frodo pippin and sam decided to join the company merry said it would be too UNK i shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit and perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air mind your UNK and UNK and dont forget that you are supposed to be escaping in secret and are still on the UNK and not very far from the shire all right said pippin mind yourself dont get lost and dont forget that it is UNK indoors the company was in the big UNK of the inn the gathering was large and mixed as frodo discovered when his eyes got used to the light this came chiefly from a blazing UNK for the three lamps hanging from the UNK were dim and half veiled in smoke barliman butterbur was standing near the fire talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two UNK men on the UNK were various folk men of bree a UNK of local hobbits sitting UNK together a few more dwarves and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows and UNK as soon as the shire-hobbits entered there was a chorus of welcome from the UNK the strangers especially those that had come up the greenway stared at them curiously the landlord introduced the UNK to the bree-folk so quickly that though they caught many names they were seldom sure who the names belonged to the men of bree seemed all to have rather UNK and to the shire-folk rather odd names like UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and ferny not to mention butterbur some of the hobbits had similar names the mug UNK for instance seemed numerous but most of them had natural names such as banks UNK UNK UNK and UNK many of which were used in the shire there were several UNK from saddle and as they could not imagine UNK a name without being related they took frodo to their hearts as a UNK cousin the UNK were in fact friendly and inquisitive and frodo soon found that some explanation of what he was doing would have to be given he gave out that he was interested in history and UNK at which there was much UNK of heads although neither of these words were much used in the UNK he said he was thinking of writing a book at which there was silent astonishment and that he and his friends wanted to UNK information about hobbits living outside the shire especially in the eastern lands at this a chorus of voices broke out if frodo had really wanted to write a book and had had many ears he would have learned enough for several chapters in a few minutes and if that was not enough he was given a whole UNK of names beginning with old barliman here to whom he could go for further information but after a time as frodo did not show any sign of writing a book on the spot the hobbits returned to their questions about doings in the shire frodo did not prove very UNK and he soon found himself sitting alone in a comer listening and looking around the men and dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and telling UNK of a kind that was becoming only too familiar there was trouble away in the south and it seemed that the men who had come up the greenway were on the move looking for lands where they could find some peace the bree-folk were UNK but plainly not very ready to take a large number of strangers into their little land one of the travellers a UNK UNK fellow was UNK that more and more people would be coming north in the near future if room isnt found for them theyll find it for themselves theyve a right to live same as other folk he said loudly the local inhabitants did not look pleased at the prospect the hobbits did not pay much attention to all this and it did not at the moment seem to concern hobbits big folk could hardly beg for UNK in UNK they were more interested in sam and pippin who were now feeling quite at home and were UNK UNK about events in the shire pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the UNK of the roof of the UNK hole in michel delving will UNK the mayor and the UNK hobbit in the UNK had been buried in UNK and came out like a UNK UNK but there were several questions asked that made frodo a little uneasy one of the UNK who seemed to have been in the shire several times wanted to know where the UNK lived and who they were related to suddenly frodo noticed that a UNK UNK man sitting in the shadows near the wall was also listening intently to the UNK he had a tall UNK in front of him and was smoking a UNK pipe curiously carved his legs were stretched out before him UNK high boots of UNK leather that UNK him well but had seen much wear and were now UNK with mud a travel UNK cloak of heavy UNK green cloth was drawn close about him and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face but the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits who is that frodo asked when he got a chance to whisper to mr butterbur i dont think you introduced him him said the landlord in an answering whisper UNK an eye without turning his head i dont rightly know he is one of the wandering folk UNK we call them he seldom talks not but what he can tell a rare tale when he has the mind he UNK for a month or a year and then he UNK up again he was in and out pretty often last spring but i havent seen him about lately what his right name is ive never heard but hes known round here as strider goes about at a great pace on his long UNK though he dont tell nobody what cause he has to hurry but theres no UNK for east and west as we say in bree meaning the rangers and the shire-folk begging your pardon funny you should ask about him but at that moment mr butterbur was called away by a demand for more ale and his last remark remained UNK frodo found that strider was now looking at him as if he had heard or guessed all that had been said presently with a wave of his hand and a UNK he invited frodo to come over and sit by him as frodo drew near be threw back his hood UNK a UNK head of dark hair UNK with grey and in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eyes i am called strider he said in a low voice i am very pleased to meet you master - underhill if old butterbur got your name right he did said frodo UNK he felt far from comfortable under the UNK of those keen eyes well master underhill said strider if i were you i should stop your young friends from talking too much drink fire and chance UNK are pleasant enough but well - this isnt the shire there are queer folk about though i say it as shouldnt you may think he added with a UNK smile seeing frodos glance and there have been even stranger travellers through bree lately he went on watching frodos face frodo returned his gaze but said nothing and strider made no further sign his attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on pippin to his alarm frodo became aware that the ridiculous young took encouraged by his UNK with the fat mayor of michel delving was now actually giving a UNK account of bilbos farewell party he was already giving an UNK of the speech and was drawing near to the astonishing disappearance frodo was annoyed it was a UNK enough tale for most of the local hobbits no doubt just a funny story about those funny people away beyond the river but some old butterbur for instance knew a thing or two and had probably heard rumours long ago about bilbos vanishing it would bring the name of baggins to their minds especially if there had been UNK in bree after that name frodo UNK wondering what to do pippin was evidently much UNK the attention he was getting and had become quite UNK of their danger frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even mention the ring and that might well be UNK you had better do something quick whispered strider in his ear frodo jumped up and stood on a table and began to talk the attention of UNK audience was disturbed some of the hobbits looked at frodo and laughed and clapped thinking that mr underhill had taken as much ale as was good for him frodo suddenly felt very foolish and found himself as was his habit when making a speech fingering the things in his pocket he felt the ring on its chain and quite UNK the desire came over him to slip it on and vanish out of the silly UNK it seemed to him somehow as if me UNK came to him from outside from someone or something a the room he UNK the UNK firmly and UNK the ring in his hand as if to keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief at any rate it gave him no UNK he spoke a few UNK words as they would have said in the shire we are all very much UNK by the kindness of your UNK and i venture to hope that my brief visit will help to UNK the old UNK of friendship between the shire and bree and then he hesitated and UNK everyone in the room was now looking at him a song shouted one of the hobbits a song a song shouted all the others come on now master sing us something that we havent heard before for a moment frodo stood gaping then in UNK he began a ridiculous song that bilbo had been rather fond of and indeed rather proud of for he had made up the words himself it was about an inn and that is probably why it came into frodos mind just then here it is in full only a few words of it are now as a rule remembered there is an inn a merry old inn beneath an old grey hill and there they UNK a beer so brown that the man in the moon himself came down one night to drink his fill the UNK has a UNK cat that UNK a UNK fiddle and up and down he runs his bow now UNK high now UNK low now UNK in the middle the landlord UNK a little dog that is mighty fond of UNK when theres good UNK among the guests he UNK an ear at all the UNK and UNK until he UNK they also keep a UNK cow as proud as any queen but music turns her head like ale and makes her wave her UNK tail and dance upon the green and o the UNK of silver UNK and the store of silver spoons for UNK theres a special pair and these they UNK up with care on UNK UNK the man in the moon was drinking deep and the cat began to UNK a dish and a UNK on the table danced the cow in the garden UNK UNK and the little dog UNK his tail the man in the moon took another mug and then rolled beneath his chair and there he UNK and UNK of ale till in the sky the stars were pale and dawn was in the air then the UNK said to his UNK cat the white horses of the moon they UNK and UNK their silver bits but their masters been and drowned his wits and the UNK be rising soon so the cat on his fiddle played UNK a UNK that would wake the dead he UNK and UNK and UNK the tune while the landlord shook the man in the moon its after three he said they rolled the man slowly up the hill and UNK him into the moon while his horses galloped up in rear and the cow came UNK like a UNK and a dish ran up with the UNK now quicker the fiddle went UNK the dog began to roar the cow and the horses stood on their heads the guests all UNK from their beds and danced upon the floor with a UNK and a UNK the UNK broke the cow jumped over the moon and the little dog laughed to see such fun and the UNK dish went off at a run with the silver UNK UNK the round moon rolled behind the hill as the sun raised up her head she  hardly believed her fiery eyes for though it was day to her surprise they all went back to bed there was loud and long UNK frodo had a good voice and the song UNK their fancy wheres old barley they cried he ought to hear this bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle and then wed have a dance they called for more ale and began to shout lets have it again master come on now once more they made frodo have another drink and then begin his song again while many of them joined in for the tune was well known and they were quick at picking up words it was now frodos turn to feel pleased with himself he UNK about on the table and when he came a second time to the cow jumped over the moon he leaped in the air much too UNK for he came down UNK into a tray full of mugs and slipped and rolled off the table with a crash UNK and UNK the audience all opened their mouths wide for laughter and stopped short a gaping silence for the UNK disappeared he simply vanished as if he had gone UNK through the floor without leaving a hole  the local hobbits stared in amazement and then sprang to their feet and shouted for barliman all the company drew away from pippin and sam who found themselves left alone in a comer and UNK darkly and doubtfully from a distance it was plain that many people regarded them now as the companions of a UNK UNK of unknown powers and purpose but there was one UNK UNK who stood looking at them with a knowing and UNK expression that made them feel very uncomfortable presently he slipped out of the door followed by the UNK UNK the two had been whispering together a good deal during the evening UNK the gatekeeper also went out just behind them frodo felt a fool not knowing what else to do he crawled away under the tables to the dark comer by strider who sat UNK giving no sign of his thoughts frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the ring how it came to be on his finger he could not tell he could only suppose that he had been UNK it in his pocket while he sang and that somehow it had slipped on when he stuck out his hand with a UNK to save his fall for a moment he wondered if the ring itself had not played him a trick perhaps it had tried to reveal itself in UNK to some wish or command that was felt in the room he did not like the looks of the men that had gone out well said strider when he reappeared why did you do that worse than anything your friends could have said you have put your foot in it or should i say your finger i dont know what you mean said frodo annoyed and alarmed oh yes you do answered strider but we had better wait until the UNK has died down then if you please mr baggins i should like a quiet word with you what about asked frodo UNK the sudden use of his proper name a matter of some importance - to us both answered strider looking frodo in the eye you may hear something to your UNK very well said frodo trying to appear UNK ill talk to you later meanwhile an UNK was going on by the UNK mr butterbur had come trotting in and he was now trying to listen to several UNK accounts of the event at the same time i saw him mr butterbur said a hobbit or UNK i didnt see him if you take my meaning he just vanished into thin air in a manner of speaking you dont say mr UNK said the landlord looking puzzled yes i do replied UNK and i mean what i say whats more theres some mistake somewhere said butterbur shaking his head there was too much of that mr underhill to go vanishing into thin air or into thick air as is more likely in this room well where is he now cried several voices how should i know hes welcome to go where he will so long as he UNK in the morning theres mr took now hes not vanished well i saw what i saw and i saw what i didnt said UNK UNK and i say theres some mistake repeated butterbur picking up the tray and gathering up the broken UNK of course theres a mistake said frodo i havent vanished here i am ive just been having a few words with strider in the comer he came forward into the firelight but most of the company UNK away even more UNK than before they were not in the least UNK by his explanation that he had crawled away quickly under the tables after he had fallen most of the hobbits and the men of bree went off then and there in a UNK having no fancy for further UNK that evening one or two gave frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves the dwarves and the two or three strange men that still remained got up and said good night to the landlord but not to frodo and his friends before long no one was left but strider who sat on UNK by the wall mr butterbur did not seem much put out he reckoned very probably that his house would be full again on many future nights until the present UNK had been UNK discussed now what have you been doing mr underhill he asked UNK my UNK and breaking up my UNK with your UNK i am very sorry to have UNK any trouble said frodo it was quite UNK i UNK you a most UNK accident all right mr underhill but if youre going to do any more UNK or UNK or whatever it was youd best warn folk UNK - and warn me were a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way UNK if you understand me and we dont take to it all of a sudden i shant be doing anything of the sort again mr butterbur i promise you and now i think ill be getting to bed we shall be making an early start will you see that our ponies are ready by eight oclock very good but before you go i should like a word with you in private mr underhill something has just come back to my mind that i ought to tell you i hope that youll not take it amiss when ive seen to a thing or two ill come along to your room if youre willing certainly said frodo but his heart sank he wondered how many private talks he would have before he got to bed and what they would reveal were these people all in league against him he began to suspect even old UNK fat face of UNK dark designs chapter  strider frodo pippin and sam made their way back to the UNK there was no light merry was not there and the fire had burned low it was not until they had puffed up the UNK into a blaze and thrown on a couple of UNK that they discovered strider had come with them there he was UNK sitting in a chair by the door hallo said pippin who are you and what do you want i am called strider he answered and though he may have forgotten it your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me you said i might hear something to my UNK i believe said frodo what have you to say several things answered strider but of course i have my price what do you mean asked frodo sharply dont be alarmed i mean just this i will tell you what i know and give you some good advice - but i shall want a reward and what will that be pray said frodo he UNK now that he had fallen in with a UNK and he thought UNK that he had brought only a little money with him all of it would hardly UNK a UNK and he could not spare any of it no more than you can afford answered strider with a slow smile as if he guessed frodos thoughts just this you must take me along with you until i wish to leave you oh indeed replied frodo surprised but not much relieved even if i wanted another companion i should not agree to any such thing until i knew a good deal more about you and your business excellent exclaimed strider crossing his legs and sitting back UNK you seem to be coming to your senses again and that is all to the good you have been much too UNK so far very well i will tell you what i know and leave the reward to you you may be glad to UNK it when you have heard me go on then said frodo what do you know too much too many dark things said strider grimly but as for your business   he got up and went to the door opened it quickly and looked out then he shut it quietly and sat down again i have quick ears he went on UNK his voice and though i cannot UNK i have hunted many wild and wary things and i can usually avoid being seen if i wish now i was behind the hedge this evening on the road west of bree when four hobbits came out of the UNK i need not repeat all that they said to old bombadil or to one another but one thing interested me please remember said one of them that the name baggins must not be mentioned i am mr underhill if any name must be given that interested me so much that i followed them here i slipped over the gate just behind them maybe mr baggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind but if so i should advise him and his friends to be more careful i dont see what interest my name has for any one in bree said frodo UNK and i have still to learn why it UNK you mr strider may have an honest reason for UNK and UNK but if so i should advise him to explain it well answered said strider laughing but the explanation is simple i was looking for a hobbit called frodo baggins i wanted to find him quickly i had learned that he was carrying out of the shire well a secret that concerned me and my friends now dont mistake me he cried as frodo rose from his seat and sam jumped up with a UNK i shall take more care of the secret than you do and care is needed he leaned forward and looked at them watch every shadow he said in a low voice black horsemen have passed through bree on UNK one came down the greenway they say and another appeared later coming up the greenway from the south there was a silence at last frodo spoke to pippin and sam i ought to have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us he said and the landlord seems to have heard something why did he UNK us to join the company and why on earth did we UNK so UNK we ought to have stayed quiet in here it would have been better said strider i would have stopped your going into the UNK if i could but the innkeeper would not let me in to see you or take a message do you think he  began frodo no i dont think any harm of old butterbur only he does not altogether like mysterious UNK of my sort frodo gave him a puzzled look well i have rather a UNK look have i not said strider with a UNK of his lip and a queer gleam in his eye but i hope we shall get to know one another better when we do i hope you will explain what happened at the end of your song for that little UNK  it was sheer accident interrupted frodo i wonder said strider accident then that accident has made your UNK dangerous hardly more than it was already said frodo i knew these horsemen were pursuing me but now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to have gone away you must not count on that said strider sharply they will return and more are coming there are others i know their number i know these riders he paused and his eyes were cold and hard and there are some folk in bree who are not to be trusted he went on bill ferny for instance he has an evil name in the bree-land and queer folk call at his house you must have noticed him among the company a UNK UNK fellow he was very close with one of the southern strangers and they slipped out together just after your accident not all of those UNK mean well and as for ferny he would sell anything to UNK or make mischief for UNK what will ferny sell and what has my accident got to do with him said frodo still UNK not to understand striders hints news of you of course answered strider an account of your UNK would be very UNK to certain people after that they would hardly need to be told your real name it seems to me only too likely that they will hear of it before this night is over is that enough you can do as you like about my reward take me as a guide or not but i may say that i know all the lands between the shire and the misty mountains for i have wandered over them for many years i am older than i look i might prove useful you will have to leave the open road after tonight for the horsemen will watch it night and day you may escape from bree and be allowed to go forward while the sun is up but you wont go far they will come on you in the wild in some dark place where there is no help do you wish them to find you they are terrible the hobbits looked at him and saw with surprise that his face was drawn as if with pain and his hands UNK the arms of his chair the room was very quiet and still and the light seemed to have grown dim for a while he sat with UNK eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening to sounds in the night far away there he cried after a moment drawing his hand across his brow perhaps i know more about these pursuers than you do you fear them but you do not fear them enough yet tomorrow you will have to escape if you can strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden will you have him there was a heavy silence frodo made no answer his mind was UNK with doubt and fear sam UNK and looked at his master and at last he broke out with your leave mr frodo id say no this strider here he UNK and he says take care and i say yes to that and lets begin with him he comes out of the wild and i never heard no good of such folk he knows something thats plain and more than i like but its no reason why we should let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help as he UNK it pippin UNK and looked uncomfortable strider did not reply to sam but turned his keen eyes on frodo frodo caught his glance and looked away no he said slowly i dont agree i think i think you are not really as you choose to look you began to talk to me like the bree-folk but your voice has changed still sam seems right in this i dont see why you should warn us to take care and yet ask us to take you on trust why the UNK who are you what do you really know about - about my business and how do you know it the UNK in UNK has been well learned said strider with a grim smile but UNK is one thing and UNK is another you will never get to rivendell now on your own and to trust me is your only chance you must make up your mind i will answer some of your questions if that will help you to do so but why should you believe my story if you do not trust me already still here it is  at that moment there came a knock at the door mr butterbur had arrived with candles and behind him was nob with UNK of hot water strider UNK into a dark corner ive come to bid you good night said the landlord putting the candles on the table nob take the water to the rooms he came in and shut the door its like this he began hesitating and looking troubled if ive done any harm im sorry indeed but one thing UNK out another as youll admit and im a busy man but first one thing and then another this week have UNK my memory as the saying goes and not too late i hope you see i was asked to look out for hobbits of the shire and for one by the name of baggins in UNK and what has that got to do with me asked frodo ah you know best said the landlord UNK i wont give you away but i was told that this baggins would be going by the name of underhill and i was given a UNK that UNK you well enough if i may say so indeed lets have it then said frodo UNK interrupting a stout little fellow with red UNK  said mr butterbur solemnly pippin UNK but sam looked UNK that wont help you much it goes for most hobbits barley he says to me continued mr butterbur with a glance at pippin but this one is taller than some and fairer than most and he has a cleft in his chin UNK UNK with a bright eye begging your pardon but he said it not me he said it and who was he asked frodo eagerly ah that was gandalf if you know who i mean a wizard they say he is but hes a good friend of mine whether or no but now i dont know what hell have to say to me if i see him again turn all my ale UNK or me into a UNK of wood i shouldnt wonder hes a bit UNK still whats done cant be UNK  well what have you done said frodo getting UNK with the slow UNK of UNK thoughts where was i said the landlord UNK and UNK his fingers ah yes  old gandalf three months back he walked right into my room without a knock barley he says im off in the morning will you do something for me youve only to name it i said im in a hurry said he and ive no time myself but i want a message took to the shire have you anyone you can send and trust to go i can find someone i said tomorrow maybe or the day after make it tomorrow he says and then he gave me a letter its UNK plain enough said mr butterbur UNK a letter from his pocket and reading out the UNK slowly and proudly he UNK his reputation as a UNK man mr frodo baggins bag end hobbiton in the shire a letter for me from gandalf cried frodo ah said mr butterbur then your right name is baggins it is said frodo and you had better give me that letter at once and explain why you never sent it thats what you came to tell me i suppose though youve taken a long time to come to the point poor mr butterbur looked troubled youre right master he said and i beg your pardon and im mortal afraid of what gandalf will say if harm comes of it but i didnt keep it back UNK i put it by safe then i couldnt find nobody willing to go to the shire next day nor the day after and none of my own folk were to spare and then one thing after another drove it out of my mind im a busy man ill do what i can to set matters right and if theres any help i can give youve only to name it leaving the letter aside i promised gandalf no less barley he says to me this friend of mine from the shire he may be coming out this way before long him and another hell be calling himself underhill mind that but you need ask no questions and if im not with him he may be in trouble and he may need help do whatever you can for him and ill be grateful he says and here you are and trouble is not far off UNK what do you mean asked frodo these black men said the landlord UNK his voice theyre looking for baggins and if they mean well then im a hobbit it was on UNK and all the dogs were UNK and the UNK UNK UNK i called it nob he came and told me that two black men were at the door asking for a hobbit called baggins UNK hair was all stood on end i bid the black fellows be off and UNK the door on them but theyve been asking the same question all the way to archet i hear and that ranger strider hes been asking questions too tried to get in here to see you before youd had bite or UNK he did fie did said strider suddenly coming forward into the light and much trouble would have been saved if you had let him in barliman the landlord jumped with surprise you he cried youre always UNK up what do you want now hes here with my leave said frodo he came to offer me his help well you know your own business maybe said mr butterbur looking suspiciously at strider but if i was in your plight i wouldnt take up with a ranger then who would you take up with asked strider a fat innkeeper who only UNK his own name because people shout it at him all day they cannot stay in the pony for ever and they cannot go home they have a long road before them will you go with them and keep the black men off me leave bree i wouldnt do that for any money said mr butterbur looking really scared but why cant you stay here quiet for a bit mr underhill what are all these queer UNK on what are these black men after and where do they come from id like to know im sorry i cant explain it all answered frodo i am tired and very worried and its a long tale but if you mean to help me i ought to warn you that you will be in danger as long as i am in your house these black riders i am not sure but i think i fear they come from  they come from mordor said strider in a low voice from mordor barliman if that means anything to you save us cried mr butterbur turning pale the name evidently was known to him that is the worst news that has come to bree in my time it is said frodo are you still willing to help me i am said mr butterbur more than ever though i dont know what the likes of me can do against against  he UNK against the shadow in the east said strider quietly not much barliman but every little UNK you can let mr underhill stay here tonight as mr underhill and you can forget the name of baggins till he is far away ill do that said butterbur but theyll find out hes here without help from me im afraid its a pity mr baggins drew attention to himself this evening to say no more the story of that mr bilbos going off has been heard before tonight in bree even our nob has been doing some guessing in his slow UNK and there are others in bree quicker in the UNK than he is well we can only hope the riders wont come back yet said frodo i hope not indeed said butterbur but UNK or no UNK they wont get in the pony so easy dont you worry till the morning UNK say no word no black man shall pass my doors while i can stand on my legs me and my UNK keep watch tonight but you had best get some sleep if you can in any case we must be called at dawn said frodo we must get off as early as possible breakfast at UNK please right ill see to the orders said the landlord good night mr baggins - underhill i should say good night - now bless me wheres your mr brandybuck i dont know said frodo with sudden anxiety they had forgotten all about merry and it was getting late i am afraid he is out he said something about going for a breath of air well you do want looking after and no mistake your party might be on a holiday said butterbur i must go and bar the doors quick but ill see your friend is let in when he comes id better send nob to look for him good night to you all at last mr butterbur went out with another doubtful look at strider and a shake of his head his footsteps retreated down the passage well said strider when are you going to open that letter frodo looked carefully at the UNK before he broke it it seemed certainly to be gandalf s inside written in the wizards strong but UNK script was the following message the prancing pony bree UNK day shire year  dear frodo bad news has reached me here i must go off at once you had better leave bag end soon and get out of the shire before the end of UNK at latest i will return as soon as i can and i will follow you if i find that you are gone leave a message for me here if you pass through bree you can trust the landlord butterbur you may meet a friend of mine on the road a man lean dark tall by some called strider he knows our business and will help you make for rivendell there i hope we may meet again if i do not come elrond will advise you yours in haste gandalf UNK do not use it again not far any reason whatever do not travel by night UNK make sure that it is the real strider there are many strange men on the roads his true name is aragorn all that is gold does not UNK not all those who wander are lost the old that is strong does not UNK deep roots are not reached by the frost from the ashes a fire shall be UNK a light from the shadows shall spring UNK shall be blade that was broken the UNK again shall be king UNK i hope butterbur UNK this UNK a worthy man but his memory is like a UNK thing wanted always buried if he UNK i shall UNK him fare well  frodo read the letter to himself and then passed it to pippin and sam really old butterbur has made a UNK of things he said he UNK UNK if i had got this at once we might all have been safe in rivendell by now but what can have happened to gandalf he UNK as if he was going into great danger he has been doing that for many years said strider frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully wondering about gandalf s second UNK why didnt you tell me that you were gandalf s friend at once he asked it would have saved time would it would any of you have believed me till now said strider i knew nothing of this letter for all i knew i had to UNK you to trust me without UNK if i was to help you in any case i did not UNK to tell you all about myself at once i had to study you first and make sure of you the enemy has set UNK for me before now as soon as i had made up my mind i was ready to tell you whatever you asked but i must admit he added with a queer laugh that i hoped you would take to me for my own sake a hunted man sometimes UNK of UNK and UNK for friendship but there i believe my looks are against me they are - at first sight at any rate laughed pippin with sudden relief after reading gandalfs letter but UNK is as UNK does as we say in the shire and i daresay we shall all look much the same after lying for days in hedges and UNK it would take more than a few days or weeks or years of wandering in the wild to make you look like strider he answered and you would die first unless you are made of UNK stuff than you look to be pippin UNK but sam was not UNK and he still UNK strider UNK how do we know you are the strider that gandalf UNK about he demanded you never mentioned gandalf till this letter came out you might be a UNK spy for all i can see trying to get us to go with you you might have done in the real strider and took his clothes what have you to say to that that you are a stout fellow answered strider but i am afraid my only answer to you sam gamgee is this if i had killed the real strider i could kill you and i should have killed you already without so much talk if i was after the ring i could have it - now he stood up and seemed suddenly to grow taller in his eyes gleamed a light keen and commanding throwing back his cloak he laid his hand on the hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side they did not dare to move sam sat UNK staring at him UNK but i am the real strider UNK he said looking down at them with his face UNK by a sudden smile i am aragorn son of arathorn and if by life or death i can save you i will there was a long silence at last frodo spoke with UNK i believed that you were a friend before the letter came he said or at least i wished to you have frightened me several times tonight but never in the way that servants of the enemy would or so i imagine i think one of his spies would - well seem fairer and feel UNK if you understand i see laughed strider i look foul and feel fair is that it all that is gold does not UNK not all those who wander are lost  did the verses UNK to you then asked frodo i could not make out what they were about but how did you know that they were in gandalf s letter if you have never seen it i did not know he answered but i am aragorn and those verses go with that name he drew out his sword and they saw that the blade was indeed broken a foot below the hilt not much use is it sam said strider but the time is near when it shall be forged UNK sam said nothing well said strider with sams UNK we will call that settled strider shall be your guide we shall have a rough road tomorrow even if we are allowed to leave bree UNK we can hardly hope now to leave it UNK but i shall try to get lost as soon as possible i know one or two ways out of bree-land other than the main road if once we shake off the pursuit i shall make for weathertop weathertop said sam whats that it is a hill just to the north of the road about half way from here to rivendell it UNK a wide view all round and there we shall have a chance to look about us gandalf will make for that point if he UNK us after weathertop our journey will become more difficult and we shall have to choose between various dangers when did you last see gandalf asked frodo do you know where he is or what he is doing strider looked grave i do not know he said i came west with him in the spring i have often kept watch on the borders of the shire in the last few years when he was busy elsewhere he seldom left it UNK we last met on the first of may at sam ford down the brandywine he told me that his business with you had gone well and that you would be starting for rivendell in the last week of september as i knew he was at your side i went away on a journey of my own and that has proved ill for plainly some news reached him and i was not at hand to help i am troubled for the first time since i have known him we should have had messages even if he could not come himself when i returned many days ago i heard the ill news the tidings had gone far and wide that gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen it was the elven-folk of gildor that told me this and later they told me that you had left your home but there was no news of your leaving buckland i have been watching the east road anxiously do you think the black riders have anything to do with it - with gandalfs UNK i mean asked frodo i do not know of anything else that could have hindered him except the enemy himself said strider but do not give up hope  gandalf is greater than you shire-folk know - as a rule you can only see his UNK and UNK but this business of ours will be his greatest task pippin yawned i am sorry he said but i am dead tired in spite of all the danger and worry i must go to bed or sleep where i sit where is that silly fellow merry it would be the last UNK if we had to go out in the dark to look for him at that moment they heard a door UNK then feet came running along the passage merry came in with a rush followed by nob he shut the door hastily and leaned against it he was out of breath they stared at him in alarm for a moment before he gasped i have seen them frodo i have seen them black riders black riders cried frodo where here in the village i stayed indoors for an hour then as you did not come back i went out for a UNK i had come back again and was standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars suddenly i shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near there was a son of deeper shade among the shadows across the road just beyond the edge of the UNK it UNK away at once into the dark without a sound there was no horse which way did it go asked strider suddenly and sharply merry started UNK the stranger for the first time go on said frodo this is a friend of gandalfs i will explain later it seemed to make off up the road eastward continued merry i tried to follow of course it vanished almost at once but i went round the corner and on as far as the last house on the road strider looked at merry with wonder you have a stout heart he said but it was foolish i dont know said merry neither brave nor silly i think i could hardly help myself i seemed to be drawn somehow anyway i went and suddenly i heard voices by the hedge one was muttering and the other was whispering or hissing i couldnt hear a word that was said i did not creep any closer because i began to tremble all over then i felt terrified and i turned back and was just going to bolt home when something came behind me and i i fell over i found him sir put in nob mr butterbur sent me out with a lantern i went down to UNK and then back up towards UNK just nigh bill fernys house i thought i could see something in the road i couldnt UNK to it but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over something UNK it i gave a shout but where i got up to the spot there was no signs of them and only mr brandybuck lying by the UNK he seemed to be asleep i thought i had fallen into deep water he says to me when i shook him very queer he was and as soon as i had roused him he got up and ran back here like a UNK i am afraid thats true said merry though i dont know what i said i had an UNK dream which i cant remember i went to pieces i dont know what came over me i do said strider the black breath the riders must have left their horses outside and passed back through the UNK in secret they will know all the news now for they have visited bill ferny and probably that UNK was a spy as well something may happen in the night before we leave bree what will happen said merry will they attack the inn no i think not said strider they are not all here yet and in any case that is not their way in dark and loneliness they are UNK they will not openly attack a house where there are lights and many people UNK until they are desperate not while all the long leagues of eriador still lie before us but their power is in terror and already some in bree are in their UNK they will drive these UNK to some evil work ferny and some of the strangers and maybe the gatekeeper too they had words with UNK at UNK on UNK i was watching them he was white and shaking when they left him we seem to have enemies all round said frodo what are we to do stay here and do not go to your rooms  they are sure to have found out which those are the UNK have windows looking north and close to the ground we will all remain together and bar this window and the door but first nob and i will fetch your luggage while strider was gone frodo gave merry a UNK account of all that had happened since supper merry was still reading and UNK gandalfs letter when strider and nob returned well masters said nob ive UNK up the clothes and put in a UNK down the middle of each bed and i made a nice UNK of your head with a brown UNK UNK mr bag - underhill sir he added with a UNK pippin laughed very UNK he said but what will happen when they have UNK the UNK we shall see said strider UNK us hope to hold the UNK till morning good night to you said nob and went off to take his part in the watch on the doors their bags and gear they piled on the UNK they pushed a low chair against the door and shut the window peering out frodo saw that the night was still clear the UNK was UNK bright above the shoulders of bree-hill he then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the curtains together strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles the hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the hearth but strider settled himself in the chair against the door they talked for a little for merry still had several questions to ask jumped over the moon UNK merry as he rolled himself in his blanket very ridiculous of you frodo but i wish i had been there to see the UNK of bree will be discussing it a hundred years UNK i hope so said strider then they all fell silent and one by one the hobbits dropped off to sleep chapter  a knife in the dark as they prepared for sleep in the inn at bree darkness lay on buckland a mist strayed in the dells and along the river -bank the house at crickhollow stood silent fatty bolger opened the door cautiously and peered out a feeling of fear had been growing on him all day and he was unable to rest or go to bed there was a UNK threat in the breathless UNK as he stared out into the gloom a black shadow moved under the trees the gate seemed to open of its own UNK and close again without a sound terror seized him he shrank back and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall then he shut and locked the door the night deepened there came the soft sound of horses led with UNK along the lane outside the gate they stopped and three black figures entered like shades of night creeping across the ground one went to the door one to the corner of the house on either side and there they stood as still as the shadows of stones while night went slowly on the house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting UNK there was a faint stir in the leaves and a UNK UNK far away the cold hour before dawn was passing the figure by the door moved in the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed as if a chill light had been UNK there was a blow soft but heavy and the door shuddered open in the name of mordor said a voice thin and menacing at a second blow the door UNK and fell back with UNK burst and lock broken the black figures passed swiftly in at that moment among the trees nearby a horn rang out it UNK the night like fire on a hill -top awake fear fire foes awake fatty bolger had not been idle as soon as he saw the dark shapes creep from the garden he knew that he must run for it or UNK and run he did out of the back door through the garden and over the fields when he reached the nearest house more than a mile away he UNK on the doorstep no no no he was crying no not me i havent got it it was some time before anyone could make out what he was UNK about at last they got the idea that enemies were in buckland some strange UNK from the old forest and then they lost no more time fear fire foes the brandybucks were blowing the UNK of buckland that had not been sounded for a hundred years not since the white wolves came in the fell winter when the brandywine was frozen over awake awake UNK answering horns were heard the alarm was spreading the black figures fled from the house one of them let fall a UNK on the step as he ran in the lane the noise of hoofs broke out and gathering to a UNK went UNK away into the darkness all about crickhollow there was the sound of horns blowing and voices crying and feet running but the black riders rode like a UNK to the north-gate let the little people blow sauron would deal with them later meanwhile they had another errand they knew now that the house was empty and the ring had gone they rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from the shire in the early night frodo woke from deep sleep suddenly as if some sound or presence had disturbed him he saw that strider was sitting UNK in his chair his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire which had been tended and was burning brightly but he made no sign or movement frodo soon went to sleep again but his dreams were again troubled with the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs the wind seemed to be curling round the house and shaking it and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly he opened his eyes and heard a UNK UNK UNK in the UNK strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a UNK the first grey light of day was in the room and a cold air was coming through the open window as soon as strider had roused them all he led the way to their UNK when they saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice the windows had been forced open and were UNK and the curtains were UNK the beds were tossed about and the UNK UNK and flung upon the floor the brown UNK was UNK to pieces strider immediately went to fetch the landlord poor mr butterbur looked sleepy and frightened he had hardly closed his eyes all night so he said but he had never heard a sound never has such a thing happened in my time he cried UNK his hands in horror guests unable to sleep in their beds and good UNK ruined and all what are we coming to dark times said strider but for the present you may be left in peace when you have got rid of us we will leave at once never mind about breakfast a drink and a bite standing will have to do we shall be packed in a few minutes mr butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready and to fetch them a bite but very soon he came back in dismay the ponies had vanished the UNK had all been opened in the night and they were gone not only merrys ponies but every other horse and beast in the place frodo was UNK by the news how could they hope to reach rivendell on foot pursued by mounted enemies they might as well set out for the moon strider sat silent for a while looking at the hobbits as if he was UNK up their strength and courage ponies would not help us to escape horsemen he said at last thoughtfully as if he guessed what frodo had in mind we should not go much slower on foot not on the roads that i mean to take i was going to walk in any case it is the food and UNK that trouble me we cannot count on getting anything to eat between here and rivendell except what we take with us and we ought to take plenty to spare for we may be delayed or forced to go UNK far out of the direct way how much are you prepared to carry on your backs as much as we must said pippin with a sinking heart but trying to show that he was UNK than he looked or felt i can carry enough for two said sam UNK cant anything be done mr butterbur asked frodo cant we get a couple of ponies in the village or even one just for the baggage i dont suppose we could UNK them but we might be able to UNK them he added doubtfully wondering if he could afford it i doubt it said the landlord UNK the two or three UNK that there were in bree were UNK in my yard and theyre gone as for other UNK horses or ponies for draught or what not there are very few of them in bree and they wont be for sale but ill do what i can ill UNK out bob and send him round as soon as may be yes said strider reluctantly you had better do that i am afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at least but so ends all hope of starting early and slipping away quietly we might as well have blown a horn to UNK our departure that was part of their plan no doubt there is one UNK of comfort said merry and more than a UNK i hope we can have breakfast while we wait - and sit down to it lets get hold of nob in the end there was more than three hours delay bob came back with the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the neighbourhood - except one bill ferny had one that he might possibly sell a poor old UNK creature it is said bob but he wont part with it for less than UNK its worth seeing how youre UNK not if i knows bill ferny bill ferny said frodo isnt there some trick wouldnt the beast bolt back to him with all our stuff or help in UNK us or something i wonder said strider but i cannot imagine any animal running home to him once it got away i fancy this is only an UNK of kind master fernys just a way of UNK his UNK from the affair the chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at UNK door but there does not seem any choice what does he want for it bill fernys price was twelve silver UNK and that was indeed at least three times the ponys UNK in those UNK it proved to be a UNK UNK and UNK animal but it did not look like dying just yet mr butterbur paid for it himself and offered merry another UNK UNK as some UNK for the lost UNK he was an honest man and UNK as things were reckoned in bree but thirty silver UNK was a UNK blow to him and being UNK by bill ferny made it harder to bear UNK matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end it turned out later that only one horse had been actually UNK the others had been driven off or had bolted in terror and were found wandering in different corners of the bree-land merrys ponies had escaped altogether and eventually having a good deal of sense they made their way to the downs in search of fatty lumpkin so they came under the care of tom bombadil for a while and were UNK but when news of the events at bree came to toms ears he sent them to mr butterbur who thus got five good beasts at a very fair price they had to work harder in bree but bob UNK them well so on the whole they were lucky they missed a dark and dangerous journey but they never came to rivendell however in the meanwhile for all mr butterbur knew his money was gone for good or for bad and he had other troubles for there was a great UNK as soon as the remaining guests were UNK and heard news of the UNK on the inn the southern travellers had lost several horses and UNK the innkeeper loudly until it became known that one of their own number had also disappeared in the night none other than bill fernys UNK companion suspicion fell on him at once if you pick up with a UNK and bring him to my house said butterbur UNK you ought to pay for all the UNK yourselves and not come shouting at me go and ask ferny where your UNK friend is but it appeared that he was UNK friend and nobody could UNK when he had joined their party after their breakfast the hobbits had to UNK and get together further UNK for the longer journey they were now expecting it was close on ten oclock before they at last got off by that time the whole of bree was UNK with excitement frodos vanishing trick the appearance of the black horsemen the UNK of the UNK and not least the news that strider the ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits made such a tale as would last for many UNK years most of the inhabitants of bree and staddle and many even from UNK and archet were crowded in the road to see the travellers start the other guests in the inn were at the doors or hanging out of the windows strider had changed his mind and he decided to leave bree by the main road any attempt to set off across country at once would only make matters worse half the inhabitants would follow them to see what they were up to and to prevent them from trespassing they said farewell to nob and bob and took leave of mr butterbur with many UNK i hope we shall meet again some day when things are merry once more said frodo i should like nothing better than to stay in your house in peace for a while they UNK off anxious and UNK under the eyes of the crowd not all the faces were friendly nor all the words that were shouted but strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the UNK and those that he stared at shut their mouths and drew away he walked in front with frodo next came merry and pippin and last came sam leading the pony which was laden with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it but already it looked less UNK as if it approved of the change in its UNK sam was UNK an apple thoughtfully he had a pocket full of them a parting present from nob and bob apples for walking and a pipe for sitting he said but i reckon ill miss them both before long the hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that UNK out of doors or UNK over walls and fences as they passed but as they drew near to the further gate frodo saw a dark UNK house behind a thick hedge the last house in the village in one of the windows he caught a glimpse of a UNK face with UNK slanting eyes but it vanished at once so thats where that UNK is hiding he thought he looks more than half like a UNK over the hedge another man was staring UNK he had heavy black brows and dark UNK eyes his large mouth curled in a UNK he was smoking a short black pipe as they approached he took it out of his mouth and UNK morning UNK he said off early found some friends at last strider nodded but did not answer morning my little friends he said to the others i suppose you know who youve taken up with thats stick UNK strider that is though ive heard other names not so pretty watch out tonight and you UNK dont go UNK my poor old pony UNK he UNK again sam turned quickly and you ferny he said put your UNK face out of sight or it will get hurt with a sudden UNK quick as lightning an apple left his hand and UNK bill square on the nose he UNK too late and UNK came from behind the hedge waste of a good apple said sam UNK and strode on at last they left the village behind the UNK of children and UNK that had followed them got tired and turned back at the UNK passing through they kept on along the road for some miles it bent to the left curving back into its eastward line as it UNK the feet of bree-hill and then it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded country to their left they could see some of the houses and hobbit UNK of staddle on the UNK UNK slopes of the hill down in a deep hollow away north of the road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed where UNK lay archet was hidden in the trees beyond after the road had run down some way and had left bree-hill standing tall and brown behind they came on a narrow track that led off towards the north this is where we leave the open and take to cover said strider not a short cut i hope said pippin our last short cut through woods nearly ended in disaster ah but you had not got me with you then laughed strider my UNK short or long dont go wrong he took a look up and down the road no one was in sight and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley his plan as far as they could understand it without knowing the country was to go towards archet at first but to bear right and pass it on the east and then to UNK as straight as he could over the wild lands to weathertop hill in that way they would if all went well cut off a great loop of the road which further on bent southwards to avoid the UNK marshes but of course they would have to pass through the marshes themselves and striders UNK of them was not encouraging however in the meanwhile walking was not unpleasant indeed if it had not been for the UNK events of the night before they would have enjoyed this pan of the journey better than any up to that time the sun was shining clear but not too hot the woods in the valley were still UNK and full of colour and seemed peaceful and wholesome strider guided them UNK among the many crossing paths although left to themselves they would soon have been at a loss he was taking a wandering course with many turns and UNK to put off any pursuit bill ferny will have watched where we left the road for certain he said though i dont think he will follow us himself he knows the land round here well enough but he knows he is not a match for me in a wood it is what he may tell others that i am afraid of i dont suppose they are far away if they think we have made for archet so much the better whether because of striders skill or for some other reason they saw no sign and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day neither UNK except birds nor UNK except one UNK and a few UNK the next day they began to UNK a steady course eastwards and still all was quiet and peaceful on the third day out from bree they came out of the chetwood the land had been falling steadily ever since they turned aside from the road and they now entered a wide flat UNK of country much more difficult to manage they were far beyond the borders of the bree-land out in the pathless wilderness and drawing near to the UNK water marshes the ground now became damp and in places UNK and here and there they came upon pools and wide UNK of reeds and rushes filled with the UNK of little hidden birds they had to pick their way carefully to keep both UNK and on their proper course at first they made UNK but as they went on their passage became slower and more dangerous the marshes were UNK and treacherous and there was no UNK trail even for rangers to find through their UNK UNK the flies began to torment them and the air was full of clouds of UNK UNK that crept up their UNK and UNK and into their hair i am being eaten alive cried pippin UNK there are more UNK than water what do they live on when they cant get hobbit asked sam UNK his neck they spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country their UNK was damp cold and uncomfortable and the biting UNK would not let them sleep there were also abominable creatures UNK the reeds and UNK that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the UNK there were UNK of them and they UNK all round UNK UNK UNK all the night until the hobbits were nearly UNK the next day the UNK was little better and the night almost as UNK though the UNK as sam called them had been left behind the UNK still pursued them as frodo lay tired but unable to close his eyes it seemed to him that far away there came a light in the eastern sky it flashed and faded many times it was not the dawn for that was still some hours off what is the light he said to strider who had risen and was standing gazing ahead into the night i do not know strider answered it is too distant to make out it is like lightning that UNK up from the hill-tops frodo lay down again but for a long while he could still see the white UNK and against them the tall dark figure of strider standing silent and watchful at last he passed into uneasy sleep they had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last UNK pools and UNK of the marshes behind them the land before them began steadily to rise again away in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hills the UNK of them was at the right of the line and a little UNK from the others it had a UNK top UNK UNK at the summit that is weathertop said strider the old road which we have left far away on our right runs to the south of it and passes not far from its foot we might reach it by noon tomorrow if we go straight towards it i suppose we had better do so what do you mean asked frodo i mean when we do get there it is not certain what we shall find it is close to the road but surely we were UNK to find gandalf there yes but the hope is faint if he comes this way at all he may not pass through bree and so he may not know what we are doing and anyway unless by luck we UNK almost together we shall miss one another it will not be safe for him or for us to wait there long if the riders fail to find us in the wilderness they are likely to make for weathertop themselves it UNK a wide view all round indeed there are many birds and beasts in this country that could see us as we stand here from that hill-top not all the birds are to be trusted and there are other spies more evil than they are the hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills sam looked up into the pale sky UNK to see UNK or eagles UNK over them with bright unfriendly eyes you do make me feel uncomfortable and UNK strider he said what do you advise us to do asked frodo i think answered strider slowly as if he was not quite sure i think the best thing is to go as straight eastward from here as we can to make for the line of hills not for weathertop there we can strike a path i know that runs at their feet it will bring us to weathertop from the north and less openly then we shall see what we shall see all that day they plodded along until the cold and early evening came down the land became UNK and more barren but mists and UNK lay behind them on the marshes a few UNK birds were UNK and wailing until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows then an empty silence fell the hobbits thought of the soft light of sunset glancing through the cheerful windows of bag end far away at the days end they came to a stream that wandered down from the hills to lose itself in the UNK UNK and they went up along its banks while the light UNK it was already night when at last they halted and made their camp under some UNK UNK -trees by the shores of the stream ahead there loomed now against the UNK sky the bleak and treeless backs of the hills that night they set a watch and strider it seemed did not sleep at all the moon was UNK and in the early night UNK a cold grey light lay on the land next morning they set out again soon after sunrise there was a frost in the air and the sky was a pale clear blue the hobbits felt refreshed as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep already they were getting used to much walking on short UNK - shorter at any rate than what in the shire they would have thought UNK enough to keep them on their legs pippin declared that frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been very odd said frodo UNK his belt considering that there is actually a good deal less of me i hope the UNK process will not go on UNK or i shall become a UNK do not speak of such things said strider quickly and with UNK UNK the hills drew nearer they made an UNK ridge often rising almost to a thousand feet and here and there falling again to low UNK or passes leading into the eastern land beyond along the UNK of the ridge the hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of UNK walls and UNK and in the UNK there still stood the ruins of old works of stone by night they had reached the feet of the westward slopes and there they camped it was the night of the fifth of october and they were six days out from bree in the morning they found for the first time since they had left the chetwood a track plain to see they turned right and followed it southwards it ran UNK taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep as much hidden as possible from the view both of the hill-tops above and of the flats to the west it dived into dells and UNK steep banks and where it passed over UNK and more open ground on either side of it there were lines of large UNK and hewn stones that UNK the travellers almost like a hedge i wonder who made this path and what for said merry as they walked along one of these UNK where the stones were unusually large and closely set i am not sure that i like it it has a - well rather a barrow- UNK look is there any barrow on weathertop no there is no barrow on weathertop nor on any of these hills answered strider the men of the west did not live here though in their latter days they UNK the hills for a while against the evil that came out of angmar this path was made to serve the UNK along the walls but long before in the first days of the north kingdom they built a great UNK on weathertop amon UNK they called it it was burned and broken and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring like a rough crown on the old hills head yet once it was tall and fair it is told that elendil stood there watching for the coming of gil-galad out of the west in the days of the last UNK the hobbits gazed at strider it seemed that he was learned in old lore as well as in the ways of the wild who was gil-galad asked merry but strider did not answer and seemed to be lost in thought suddenly a low voice murmured gil-galad was an UNK of him the UNK sadly sing the last whose realm was fair and free between the mountains and the sea his sword was long his UNK was keen his shining helm afar was seen the countless stars of heavens field were mirrored in his silver shield but long ago he rode away and where he UNK none can say for into darkness fell his star in mordor where the shadows are the others turned in amazement for the voice was sams dont stop said merry thats all i know stammered sam UNK i learned it from mr bilbo when i was a lad he used to tell me tales like that knowing how i was always one for hearing about elves it was mr bilbo as taught me my letters he was mighty book UNK was dear old mr bilbo and he wrote poetry he wrote what i have just said he did not make it up said strider it is pan of the lay that is called the fall of gil-galad which is in an ancient tongue bilbo must have UNK it i never knew that there was a lot more said sam all about mordor i didnt learn that part it gave me the UNK i never thought i should be going that way myself going to mordor cried pippin i hope it wont come to that do not speak that name so loudly said strider it was already mid-day when they drew near the southern end of the path and saw before them in the pale clear light of the october sun a UNK bank leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the hill they decided to make for the top at once while the daylight was broad UNK was no longer possible and they could only hope that no enemy or spy was UNK them nothing was to be seen moving on the hill if gandalf was anywhere about there was no sign of him on the western UNK of weathertop they found a sheltered hollow at the bottom of which there was a UNK UNK dell with grassy sides there they left sam and pippin with the pony and their packs and luggage the other three went on after half an hours UNK climb strider reached the crown of the hill frodo and merry followed tired and breathless the last slope had been steep and rocky on the top they found as strider had said a wide ring of ancient UNK now crumbling or covered with UNK grass but in the centre a UNK of broken stones had been piled they were UNK as if with fire about them the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the grass was UNK and UNK as if flames had swept the hill-top but there was no sign of any living thing standing upon the rim of the ruined circle they saw all round below them a wide prospect for the most pan of lands empty and UNK except for patches of woodland away to the south beyond which they caught here and there the glint of distant water beneath them on this southern side there ran like a UNK the old road coming out of the west and winding up and down until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east nothing was moving on it following its line eastward with their eyes they saw the mountains the nearer foothills were brown and UNK behind them stood taller shapes of grey and behind those again were high white peaks glimmering among the clouds well here we are said merry and very cheerless and UNK it looks there is no water and no shelter and no sign of gandalf but i dont blame him for not waiting - if he ever came here i wonder said strider looking round thoughtfully even if he was a day or two behind us at bree he could have arrived here first he can ride very swiftly when need UNK suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone on the top of the UNK it was UNK than the others and UNK as if it had escaped the fire he picked it up and UNK it turning it in his fingers this has been UNK UNK he said what do you think of these marks on the flat UNK frodo saw some UNK there seems to he a stroke a UNK and three more UNK he said the stroke on the left might be a UNK with thin branches said strider it might be a sign left by gandalf though one cannot be sure the UNK are fine and they certainly look fresh but the marks might mean something quite different and have nothing to do with us rangers use runes and they come here sometimes what could they mean even if gandalf made them asked merry i should say answered strider that they stood for g and were a sign that gandalf was here on october the third that is three days ago now it would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand so that he had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or UNK if that is so we must be wary i wish we could feel sure that he made the marks whatever they may mean said frodo it would be a great comfort to know that he was on the way in front of us or behind us perhaps said strider for myself i believe that he was here and was in danger there have been UNK flames here and now the light that we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mind i guess that he was attacked on this hill-top but with what UNK i cannot tell he is here no longer and we must now look after ourselves and make our own way to rivendell as best we can  how far is rivendell asked merry gazing round wearily the world looked wild and wide from weathertop i dont know if the road has ever been UNK in miles beyond the forsaken inn a days journey east of bree answered strider some say it is so far and some say otherwise it is a strange road and folk are glad to reach their journeys end whether the time is long or short but i know how long it would take me on my own feet with fair weather and no ill fortune twelve days from here to the ford of bruinen where the road UNK the loudwater that runs out of rivendell we have at least a UNK journey before us for i do not think we shall be able to use the road a UNK said frodo a lot may happen in that time it may said strider they stood for a while silent on the hill -top near its southward edge in that lonely place frodo for the first time fully realized his UNK and danger he wished UNK that his fortune had left him in the quiet and beloved shire he stared down at the UNK road leading back westward - to his home suddenly he was aware that two black specks were moving slowly along it going westward and looking again he saw that three others were creeping eastward to meet them he gave a cry and clutched striders arm look he said pointing downwards at once strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle pulling frodo down beside him merry threw himself UNK what is it he whispered i do not know but i fear the worst answered strider slowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring again and peered through a cleft between two UNK stones the light was no longer bright for the clear morning had faded and clouds creeping out of the east had now UNK the sun as it began to go down they could all see the black specks but neither frodo nor merry could make out their shapes for certain yet something told them that there far below were black riders UNK on the road beyond the foot of the hill yes said strider whose UNK sight left him in no doubt the enemy is here hastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to find their companions sam and peregrin had not been idle they had explored the small dell and the UNK slopes not far away they found a spring of clear water in the hillside and near it UNK not more than a day or two old in the dell itself they found recent UNK of a fire and other signs of a UNK camp there were some fallen rocks on the edge of the dell nearest to the hill behind them sam came upon a small store of firewood UNK UNK i wonder if old gandalf has been here he said to pippin UNK it was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems strider was greatly interested in these UNK i wish i had waited and explored the ground down here myself he said hurrying off to the spring to UNK the UNK it is just as i feared he said when he came back sam and pippin have UNK the soft ground and the marks are UNK or UNK rangers have been here lately it is they who left the firewood behind but there are also several UNK UNK that were not made by rangers at least one set was made only a day or two ago by heavy boots at least one i cannot now be certain but i think there were many UNK feet he paused and stood in anxious thought each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and UNK riders if the horsemen had already found the dell the sooner strider led them somewhere else the better sam UNK the hollow with great dislike now that he had heard news of their enemies on the road only a few miles away hadnt we better clear out quick mr strider he asked impatiently it is getting late and i dont like this hole it makes my heart sink somehow yes we certainly must decide what to do at once answered strider looking up and considering the time and the weather well sam he said at last i do not like this place either but i cannot think of anywhere better that we could reach before nightfall at least we are out of sight for the moment and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen spies all we could do would be to go right out of our way back north on this side of the line of hills where the land is all much the same as it is here the road is watched but we should have to cross it if we tried to take cover in the thickets away to the south on the north side of the road beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles can the riders see  asked merry i mean they seem usually to have used their noses rather than their eyes smelling for us if smelling is the right word at least in the daylight but you made us lie down flat when you saw them down below and now you talk of being seen if we move i was too UNK on the hill-top answered strider i was very anxious to find some sign of gandalf but it was a mistake for three of us to go up and stand there so long for the black horses can see and the riders can use men and other creatures as spies as we found at bree they themselves do not see the world of light as we do but our shapes cast shadows in their minds which only the noon sun UNK and in the dark they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us then they are most to be feared and at all times they smell the blood of living things UNK and UNK it senses too there are other than sight or smell we can feel their presence - it troubled our hearts as soon as we came here and before we saw them they feel ours more UNK also he added and his voice sank to a whisper the ring draws them is there no escape then said frodo looking round wildly if i move i shall be seen and hunted if i stay i shall draw them to me strider laid his hand on his shoulder there is still hope he said you are not alone let us take this wood that is set ready for the fire as a sign there is little shelter or defence here but fire shall serve for both sauron can put fire to his evil uses as he can all things but these riders do not love it and fear those who wield it fire is our friend in the wilderness maybe muttered sam it is also as good a way of saying here we are as i can think of bar shouting down in the UNK and most sheltered corner of the dell they lit a fire and prepared a meal the shades of evening began to fall and it grew cold they were suddenly aware of great hunger for they had not eaten anything since breakfast but they dared not make more than a UNK supper the lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts unfriendly places deserted by all the UNK of the world rangers passed at times beyond the hills but they were few and did not stay other wanderers were rare and of evil sort trolls might stray down at times out of the northern valleys of the misty mountains only on the road would travellers be found most often dwarves hurrying along on business of their own and with no help and few words to spare for strangers i dont see how our food can be made to last said frodo we have been careful enough in the last few days and this supper is no feast but we have used more than we ought if we have two weeks still to go and perhaps more there is food in the wild said strider UNK root and UNK and i have some skill as a UNK at need you need not be afraid of UNK before winter comes but gathering and catching food is long and weary work and we need haste so UNK your UNK and think with hope of the tables of elronds house the cold increased as darkness came on peering out from the edge of the dell they could see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into shadow the sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling stars frodo and his companions huddled round the fire wrapped in every UNK and blanket they possessed but strider was content with a single cloak and sat a little apart drawing thoughtfully at his pipe as night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brightly he began to tell them tales to keep their minds from fear he knew many histories and legends of long ago of elves and men and the good and evil deeds of the elder days they wondered how old he was and where he had learned all this lore tell us of gil-galad said merry suddenly when he paused at the end of a story of the UNK do you know any more of that old lay that you spoke of i do indeed answered strider so also does frodo for it concerns us closely merry and pippin looked at frodo who was staring into the fire i know only the little that gandalf has told me said frodo slowly gil-galad was the last of the great UNK of middle-earth gil-galad is starlight in their tongue with elendil the elf-friend he went to the land of  no said strider interrupting i do not think that tale should be told now with the servants of the enemy at hand if we UNK through to the house of elrond you may hear it there told in full then tell us some other tale of the old days begged sam a tale about the elves before the fading time i would dearly like to hear more about elves the dark seems to UNK round so close i will tell you the tale of tinviel said strider in brief - for it is a long tale of which the end is not known and there are none now except elrond that remember it UNK as it was told of old it is a fair tale though it is sad as are all the tales of middle-earth and yet it may UNK up your hearts he was silent for some time and then he began not to speak but to UNK softly the leaves were long the grass was green the UNK tall and fair and in the glade a light was seen of stars in shadow shimmering tinviel was dancing there to music of a pipe unseen and light of stars was in her hair and in her UNK glimmering there beren came from mountains cold and lost he wandered under leaves and where the UNK rolled he walked alone and UNK he peered between the UNK and saw in wander flowers of gold upon her UNK and her UNK and her hair like shadow following UNK healed his weary feet that over hills were UNK to UNK and forth he hastened strong and UNK and UNK at UNK glistening through woven woods in UNK she UNK fled on dancing feet and left him lonely still to UNK in the silent forest listening he heard there oft the flying sound of feet as light as UNK or music UNK UNK in hidden hollows UNK now withered lay the UNK and one by one with sighing sound whispering fell the UNK leaves in the UNK woodland UNK he sought her ever wandering far where leaves of years were UNK UNK by light of moon and UNK of star in UNK heavens shivering her UNK glinted in the moon as on a hill-top high and far she danced and at her feet was UNK a mist of silver quivering when winter passed she came again and her song released the sudden spring like rising UNK and falling rain and UNK water bubbling he saw the UNK spring about her feet and healed again he longed by her to dance and sing upon the grass UNK again she fled but swift he came tinviel tinviel he called her by her elvish name and there she halted listening one moment stood she and a spell his voice laid on her beren came and doom fell on tinviel that in his arms lay glistening as beren looked into her eyes within the shadows of her hair the trembling starlight of the UNK he saw there mirrored shimmering tinviel the UNK UNK UNK UNK about him cast her shadowy hair and arms like silver glimmering long was the way that fate them bore UNK stony mountains cold and grey through halls of iron and UNK door and woods of UNK UNK the UNK seas between them lay and yet at last they met once more and long ago they passed away in the forest singing UNK strider sighed and paused before he spoke again that is a song he said in the UNK that is called UNK among the elves but is hard to UNK in our common speech and this is but a rough echo of it it tells of the meeting of beren son of UNK and lthien tinviel beren was a mortal man but lthien was the daughter of UNK a king of elves upon middle-earth when the world was young and she was the fairest UNK that has ever been among all the children of this world as the stars above the mists of the northern lands was her UNK and in her face was a shining light in those days the great enemy of whom sauron of mordor was but a servant dwelt in UNK in the north and the elves of the west coming back to middle-earth made war upon him to UNK the UNK which he had UNK and the fathers of men aided the elves but the enemy was UNK and UNK was slain and beren escaping through great peril came over the mountains of terror into the hidden kingdom of UNK in the forest of UNK there he beheld lthien singing and dancing in a glade beside the enchanted river UNK and he named her tinviel that is UNK in the language of old many UNK UNK them afterwards and they were UNK long tinviel UNK beren from the dungeons of sauron and together they passed through great dangers and cast down even the great enemy from his throne and took from his iron crown one of the three UNK UNK of all jewels to be the UNK of lthien to UNK her father yet at the last beren was slain by the wolf that came from the gates of UNK and he died in the arms of tinviel but she chose UNK and to die from the world so that she might follow him and it is sung that they met again beyond the UNK seas and after a brief time walking alive once more in the green woods together they passed long ago beyond the UNK of this world so it is that lthien tinviel alone of the UNK has died indeed and left the world and they have lost her whom they most loved but from her the UNK of the elf-lords of old descended among men there live still those of whom lthien was the UNK and it is said that her line shall never fail elrond of rivendell is of that kin for of beren and lthien was born UNK UNK heir and of him UNK the white whom edrendil UNK he that UNK his ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of UNK with the UNK upon his brow and of edrendil came the kings of nmenor that is westernesse as strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face dimly lit in the red glow of the UNK his eyes shone and his voice was rich and deep above him was a black starry sky suddenly a pale light appeared over the crown of weathertop behind him the UNK moon was climbing slowly above the hill that overshadowed them and the stars above the hill-top faded the story ended the hobbits moved and stretched look said merry the moon is rising it must be getting late the others looked up even as they did so they saw on the top of the hill something small and dark against the glimmer of the UNK it was perhaps only a large stone or UNK rock shown up by the pale light sam and merry got up and walked away from the fire frodo and pippin remained seated in silence strider was watching the moonlight on the hill intently all seemed quiet and still but frodo felt a cold dread creeping over his heart now that strider was no longer speaking he huddled closer to the fire at that moment sam came running back from the edge of the dell i dont know what it is he said but i suddenly felt afraid i UNK go outside this dell for any money i felt that something was creeping up the slope did you see anything asked frodo springing to his feet no sir i saw nothing but i didnt stop to look i saw something said merry or i thought i did - away westwards where the moonlight was falling on the flats beyond the shadow of the hill-tops i thought there were two or three black shapes they seemed to be moving this way keep close to the fire with your faces UNK cried strider get some of the longer sticks ready in your hands for a breathless time they sat there silent and UNK with their backs turned to the UNK each gazing into the shadows that UNK them nothing happened there was no sound or movement in the night frodo stirred feeling that he must break the silence he longed to shout out aloud hush whispered strider whats that gasped pippin at the same moment over the lip of the little dell on the side away from the hill they felt rather than saw a shadow rise one shadow or more than one they UNK their eyes and the shadows seemed to grow soon there could be no doubt three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope looking down on them so black were they that they seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind them frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of UNK breath and felt a thin piercing chill then the shapes slowly advanced terror overcame pippin and merry and they threw themselves flat on the ground sam shrank to frodos side frodo was hardly less terrified than his companions he was quaking as if he was bitter cold but his terror was UNK up in a sudden UNK to put on the ring the desire to do this laid hold of him and he could think of nothing else fie did not forget the barrow nor the message of gandalf but something seemed to be UNK him to UNK all warnings and he longed to yield not with the hope of escape or of doing anything either good or bad he simply felt that he must take the ring and put it on his finger fie could not speak fie felt sam looking at him as if he knew that his master was in some great trouble but he could not turn towards him he shut his eyes and struggled for a while but UNK became UNK and at last he slowly drew out the chain and slipped the ring on the UNK of his left hand immediately though everything else remained as before dim and dark the shapes became terribly clear he was able to see beneath their black UNK there were five tall figures two standing on the lip of the dell three UNK in their white faces burned keen and UNK eyes under their UNK were long grey robes upon their grey UNK were UNK of silver in their UNK hands were swords of steel their eyes fell on him and pierced him as they rushed towards him desperate he drew his own sword and it seemed to him that it flickered red as if it was a UNK two of the figures halted the third was taller than the others his hair was long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown in one hand he held a long sword and in the other a knife both the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale light he sprang forward and bore down on frodo at that moment frodo threw himself forward on the ground and he heard himself crying aloud o elbereth gilthoniel at the same time he struck at the feet of his enemy a shrill cry rang out in the night and he felt a pain like a UNK of UNK UNK pierce his left shoulder even as he UNK he caught as through a swirling mist a glimpse of strider leaping out of the darkness with a UNK brand of wood in either hand with a last effort frodo UNK his sword slipped the ring from his finger and closed his right hand tight upon it chapter   flight to the ford when frodo came to himself he was still clutching the ring UNK he was lying by the fire which was now piled high and burning brightly his three companions were bending over him what has happened where is the pale king he asked wildly they were too UNK to hear him speak to answer for a while nor did they understand his question at length he gathered from sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them suddenly to his horror sam found that his master had vanished and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him and he fell he heard frodos voice but it seemed to come from a great distance or from under the earth crying out strange words they saw nothing more until they stumbled over the body of frodo lying as if dead face downwards on the grass with his sword beneath him strider ordered them to pick him up and lay him near the fire and then he disappeared that was now a good while ago sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about strider but while they were talking he returned UNK suddenly out of the shadows they started and sam drew his sword and stood over frodo but strider UNK down swiftly at his side i am not a black rider sam he said gently nor in league with them i have been trying to discover something of their movements but i have found nothing i cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again but there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand when he heard what frodo had to tell he became full of concern and shook his head and sighed then he ordered pippin and merry to heat as much water as they could in their small UNK and to bathe the wound with it keep the fire going well and keep frodo warm he said then he got up and walked away and called sam to him i think i understand things better now he said in a low voice there seem only to have been five of the enemy why they were not all here i dont know but i dont think they expected to be UNK they have drawn off for the time being but not far i fear they will come again another night if we cannot escape they are only waiting because they think that their purpose is almost UNK and that the ring cannot fly much further i fear sam that they believe your master has a deadly wound that will UNK him to their will we shall see sam choked with tears dont despair said strider you must trust me now your frodo is made of UNK stuff than i had guessed though gandalf UNK that it might prove so he is not slain and i think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect i will do all i can to help and heal him guard him well while i am away he hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness frodo UNK though the pain of his wound was slowly growing and a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side his friends watched over him UNK him and UNK his wound the night passed slowly and wearily dawn was growing in the sky and the dell was filling with grey light when strider at last returned look he cried and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that had lain there hidden by the darkness a foot above the lower UNK there was a UNK this was the stroke of frodos sword he said the only hurt that it did to his enemy i fear for it is UNK but all blades UNK that pierce that dreadful king more deadly to him was the name of elbereth and more deadly to frodo was this he stooped again and lifted up a long thin knife there was a cold gleam in it as strider raised it they saw that near the end its edge was UNK and the point was broken off but even as he held it up in the growing light they gazed in astonishment for the blade seemed to melt and vanished like a smoke in the air leaving only the hilt in striders hand alas he cried it was this UNK knife that gave the wound few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons but i will do what i can he sat down on the ground and taking the UNK UNK laid it on his knees and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue then setting it aside he turned to frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch from the UNK at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a plant these leaves he said i have walked far to find for this plant does not grow in the bare hills but in the thickets away south of the road i found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves he UNK a leaf in his fingers and it gave out a sweet and UNK fragrance it is UNK that i could find it for it is a healing plant that the men of the west brought to middle-earth UNK they named it and it grows now UNK and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old and it is not known in the north except to some of those who wander in the wild it has great UNK but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small he threw the leaves into UNK water and UNK frodos shoulder the fragrance of the steam was UNK and those that were UNK felt their minds UNK and cleared the UNK had also some power over the wound for frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold UNK in his side but the life did not return to his arm and he could not UNK or use his hand he UNK UNK his UNK and UNK himself for UNK of will for he now perceived that in putting on the ring he UNK not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies he wondered if he would remain UNK for life and how they would now manage to UNK their journey he fell too weak to stand the others were discussing this very question they quickly decided to leave weathertop as soon as possible i think now said strider that the enemy has been watching this place for some days if gandalf ever came here then he must have been forced to ride away and he will not return in any case we are in great peril here after dark since the attack of last night and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go as soon as the daylight was full they had some hurried food and packed it was impossible for frodo to walk so they divided the greater part of their baggage among the four of them and put frodo on the pony in the last few days the poor beast had UNK UNK it already seemed UNK and stronger and had begun to show an UNK for its new masters especially for sam bill fernys UNK must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life they started off in a UNK direction this would mean crossing the road but it was the UNK way to more wooded country and they needed fuel for strider said that frodo must be kept warm especially at night while fire would be some protection for them all it was also his plan to UNK their journey by cutting across another great loop of the road east beyond weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards they made their way slowly and cautiously round the UNK slopes of the hill and came in a little while to the edge of the road there was no sign of the riders but even as they were hurrying across they heard far away two cries a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering trembling they sprang forward and made for the thickets that lay ahead the land before them UNK away southwards but it was wild and pathless bushes and UNK trees grew in UNK patches with wide barren UNK in between the grass was UNK UNK and grey and the leaves in the thickets were faded and falling it was a cheerless land and their journey was slow and gloomy they spoke little as they trudged along frodos heart was UNK as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down and their backs bowed under their burdens even strider seemed tired and UNK before the first days march was over frodos pain began to grow again but he did not speak of it for a long time four days passed without the ground or the UNK changing much except that behind them weathertop slowly sank and before them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer yet since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked their flight or followed them they dreaded the dark hours and kept watch in UNK by night expecting at any time to see black shapes UNK in the grey night dimly lit by the UNK veiled moon but they saw nothing and heard no sound but the UNK of withered leaves and grass not once did they feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in the dell it seemed too much to hope that the riders had already lost their trail again perhaps they were waiting to make some UNK in a narrow place at the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended strider now turned their course again UNK and on the UNK day they reached the top of a long UNK slope and saw far ahead a UNK of wooded hills away below them they could see the road UNK round the feet of the hills and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine in the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley UNK in mist i am afraid we must go back to the road here for a while said strider we have now come to the river hoarwell that the elves call UNK it flows down out of the ettenmoors the UNK north of rivendell and UNK the loud water away in the south some call it the greyflood after that it is a great water before it finds the sea there is no way over it below its UNK in the ettenmoors except by the last bridge on which the road UNK what is that other river we can see far away there asked merry that is loudwater the bruinen of rivendell answered strider the road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the bridge to the ford of bruinen but i have not yet thought how we shall cross that water one river at a time we shall be UNK indeed if we do not find the last bridge held against us next day early in the morning they came down again to the borders of the road sam and strider went forward but they found no sign of any travellers or riders here under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain strider UNK that it had fallen two days before and had washed away all UNK no horseman had passed since then as far as he could see they hurried along with all the speed they could make and after a mile or two they saw the last bridge ahead at the bottom of a short steep slope they dreaded to see black figures waiting there but they saw none strider made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the road while he went forward to UNK before long he came hurrying back i can see no sign of the enemy he said and i wonder very much what that means but i have found something very strange he held out his hand and showed a single UNK jewel i found it in the mud in the middle of the bridge he said it is a UNK an UNK whether it was set there or let fall by chance i cannot say but it brings hope to me i will take it as a sign that we may pass the bridge but beyond that i dare not keep to the road without some clearer token at once they went on again they crossed the bridge in safety hearing no sound but the water swirling against its three great arches a mile further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of the road here strider turned aside and soon they were lost in a UNK country of dark trees winding among the feet of UNK hills the hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous road behind them but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly as they went forward the hills about them steadily rose here and there upon heights and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone and the ruins of towers they had an ominous look frodo who was not walking had time to gaze ahead and to think he recalled bilbos account of his journey and the threatening towers on the hills north of the road in the country near the trolls wood where his first serious adventure had happened frodo guessed that they were now in the same region and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot who lives in this land he asked and who built these towers is this UNK no said strider trolls do not build no one lives in this land men once dwelt here ages ago but none remain now they became an evil people as legends tell for they fell under the shadow of angmar but all were destroyed in the war that brought the north kingdom to its end but that is now so long ago that the hills have forgotten them though a shadow still lies on the land where did you learn such tales if all the land is empty and UNK asked peregrin the birds and beasts do not tell tales of that son the heirs of elendil do not forget all things past said strider and many more things than i can tell are remembered in rivendell have you often been to rivendell said frodo i have said strider i dwelt there once and still i return when i may there my heart is but it is not my fate to sit in peace even in the fair house of elrond the hills now began to shut them in the road behind held on its way to the river bruinen but both were now hidden from view the travellers came into a long valley narrow deeply cloven dark and silent trees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs and piled up behind into mounting slopes of UNK the hobbits grew very weary they advanced slowly for they had to pick their way through a pathless country UNK by fallen trees and tumbled rocks as long as they could they UNK climbing for frodos sake and because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow UNK they had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet the wind began to blow steadily out of the west and UNK the water of the distant seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine UNK rain by nightfall they were all UNK and their camp was cheerless for they could not get any fire to UNK the next day the hills rose still higher and UNK before them and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their course strider seemed to be getting anxious they were nearly ten days out from weathertop and their stock of UNK was beginning to run low it went on UNK that night they camped on a stony UNK with a rock UNK behind them in which there was a shallow cave a mere UNK in the cliff frodo was restless the cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever and the UNK and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep he lay tossing and turning and listening UNK to the UNK UNK wind in UNK of rock water dripping a crack the sudden UNK fall of a UNK stone he felt that black shapes were UNK to UNK him but when he sat up he saw nothing but the back of strider sitting UNK up smoking his pipe and watching he lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the shire but it seemed faint and dim less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedge in the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped the clouds were still thick but they were breaking and pale UNK of blue appeared between them the wind was UNK again they did not start early immediately after their cold and UNK breakfast strider went off alone telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff until he came back he was going to climb up if he could and get a look at the lie of the land when he returned he was not UNK we have come too far to the north he said and we must find some way to turn back southwards again if we keep on as we are going we shall get up into the UNK far north of rivendell that is UNK and little known to me we could perhaps find our way through and come round to rivendell from the north but it would take too long for i do not know the way and our food would not last so somehow or other we must find the ford of bruinen the rest of that day they spent UNK over rocky ground they found a passage between two hills that led them into a valley running UNK the direction that they wished to take but towards the end of the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land its dark edge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a UNK saw they had a choice between going back or climbing over it they decided to attempt the climb but it proved very difficult before long frodo was obliged to UNK and struggle along on foot even so they often despaired of getting their pony up or indeed of finding a path for themselves UNK as they were the light was nearly gone and they were all UNK when at last they reached the top they had climbed on to a narrow saddle between two higher points and the land fell steeply away again only a short distance ahead frodo threw himself down and lay on the ground shivering his left arm was UNK and his side and shoulder felt as if icy UNK were laid upon them the trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dim we cannot go any further said merry to strider i am afraid this has been too much for frodo i am UNK anxious about him what are we to do do you think they will be able to cure him in ri vendell if we ever get there we shall see answered strider there is nothing more that i can do in the wilderness and it is chiefly because of his wound that i am so anxious to UNK on but i agree that we can go no further tonight what is the matter with my master asked sam in a low voice looking UNK at strider his wound was small and it is already closed theres nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder frodo has been touched by the weapons of the enemy said strider and there is some UNK or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive out but do not give up hope sam night was cold up on the high ridge they lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots of an old UNK that hung over a shallow pit it looked as if stone had once been UNK there they sat huddled together the wind blew chill through the pass and they heard the tree-tops lower down UNK and sighing frodo lay half in a dream UNK that endless dark wings were UNK by above him and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows of the hill s the morning dawned bright and fair the air was clean and the light pale and clear in a UNK washed sky their hearts were encouraged but hey longed for the sun to warm their cold stiff limbs as soon as it was light strider took merry with him and went to UNK the country from the height to the east of the pass the sun had risen and was shining brightly when he returned with more UNK news they were now going more or less in the right direction if they went on down the further side of the ridge they would have the mountains on their left some way ahead strider had caught a glimpse of the loudwater again and he knew that though it was hidden from view the road to the ford was not far from the river and lay on the side nearest to them we must make for the road again he said we cannot hope to find a path through these hills whatever danger may UNK it the road is our only way to the ford as soon as they had eaten they set out again they climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge but the way was much easier than they had expected for the slope was far less steep on this side and before long frodo was able to ride again bill fernys poor old pony was UNK an unexpected UNK for picking out a path and for UNK its rider as many UNK as possible the spirits of the party rose again even frodo felt better in the morning light but every now and again a mist seemed to UNK his sight and he passed his hands over his eyes pippin was a little ahead of the others suddenly he turned round and called to them there is a path here he cried when they came up with him they saw that he had made no mistake there were clearly the beginnings of a path that climbed with many UNK out of the woods below and faded away on the hill-top behind in places it was now faint and UNK or choked with fallen stones and trees but at one time it seemed to have been much used it was a path made by strong arms and heavy feet here and there old trees had been cut or broken down and large rocks cloven or UNK aside to make a way they followed the track for some while for it offered much the UNK way down but they went cautiously and their anxiety increased as they came into the dark woods and the path grew UNK and broader suddenly coming out of a belt of UNK it ran steeply down a slope and turned sharply to the left round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill when they came to the comer they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level strip under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees in the stony wall there was a door hanging UNK UNK upon one great UNK outside the door they all halted there was a cave or UNK behind but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen strider sam and merry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door a little wider and then strider and merry went in they did not go far for on the floor lay many old bones and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance except some great empty UNK and broken UNK surely this is a UNK if ever there was one said pippin come out you two and let us get away now we know who made the path - and we had better get off it quick there is no need i think said strider UNK out it is certainly a UNK but it seems to have been long forsaken i dont think we need be afraid but let us go on down warily and we shall see the path went on again from the door and turning to the right again across the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope pippin not liking to show strider that he was still afraid went on ahead with merry sam and strider came behind one on each side of frodos pony for the path was now broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk UNK but they had not gone very far before pippin came running back followed by merry they both looked terrified there are trolls pippin UNK down in a clearing in the woods not far below we got a sight of them through the tree-trunks they are very large we will come and look at them said strider picking up a stick frodo said nothing but sam looked scared the sun was now high and it shone down through the UNK branches of the trees and lit the clearing with bright patches of light they halted suddenly on the edge and peered through the tree-trunks holding their breath there stood the trolls three large trolls one was stooping and the other two stood staring at him strider walked forward UNK get up old stone he said and broke his stick upon the stooping troll nothing happened there was a UNK of astonishment from the hobbits and then even frodo laughed well he said we are forgetting our family history these must be the very three that were caught by gandalf UNK over the right way to UNK UNK dwarves and one hobbit i had no idea we were anywhere near the place said pippin he knew the story well bilbo and frodo had told it often but as a matter of fact he had never more than half believed it even now he looked at the stone trolls with suspicion wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them to life again you are forgetting not only your family history but all you ever knew about trolls said strider it is broad daylight with a bright sun and yet you come back trying to UNK me with a tale of live trolls waiting for us in this glade in any case you might have noticed that one of them has an old birds UNK behind his ear that would be a most UNK UNK for a live troll they all laughed frodo felt his spirits UNK the UNK of bilbos first UNK adventure was UNK the sun too was warm and UNK and the mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little they rested for some time in the glade and took their mid-day meal right under the shadow of the trolls large legs wont UNK give us a bit of a song while the sun is high said merry when they had finished we havent had a song or a tale for days not since weathertop said frodo the others looked at him dont worry about me he added i feel much better but i dont think i could sing perhaps sam could dig something out of his memory come on sam said merry theres more UNK in your head than you let on about i dont know about that said sam but how would this UNK it aint what i call proper poetry if you understand me just a bit of nonsense but these old UNK here brought it to my mind standing up with his hands behind his back as if he was at UNK he began to sing to an old tune troll sat alone on his seat of stone and UNK and UNK a bare old bone for many a year he had UNK it near for UNK was hard to come by done by UNK by in a case in the hills he dwelt alone and UNK was hard to come by up came tom with his big boots on said he to troll pray what is UNK for it looks like the UNK o my UNK UNK as should be UNK  in UNK UNK UNK this many a year has UNK been gone and i thought he were UNK  in UNK  my lad  said troll this bone i stole but what be bones that lie in a hole thy UNK was dead as a UNK o lead UNK i found his UNK UNK UNK he can spare a share for a poor old troll for he dont need his UNK  said tom  dont see why the likes o thee without UNK  leave should go UNK free with the UNK or the UNK o my fathers kin so hand the old bone over UNK UNK though dead he be it belongs to he so hand the old bone over for a couple o UNK says troll and UNK ill eat thee too and UNK thy UNK a bit o fresh meal will go down sweet ill try my teeth on thee now UNK now see now im tired o UNK old bones and UNK ive a mind to UNK on thee now  but just as he thought his dinner was caught he found his hands had hold of naught before he could mind tom slipped behind and gave him the UNK to UNK him warn him UNK him a UNK o the UNK on the seat tom thought would be the way to UNK him but harder than stone is the UNK and bone of a troll that UNK in the hills alone as well set your UNK to the mountains root for the seat of a troll don t feel it UNK it heal it old troll laughed when he heard tom UNK and he knew his toes could feel it toms UNK is game since home he came and his UNK foot is lasting UNK but troll dont care and hes still there with the bone he UNK from its UNK UNK UNK trolls old seat is still the same and the bone he UNK from its UNK well thats a warning to us all laughed merry it is as well you used a stick and not your hand strider where did you come by that sam asked pippin ive never heard those words before sam muttered something UNK its out of his own head of course said frodo i am UNK a lot about sam gamgee on this journey first he was a UNK now hes a UNK hell end up by becoming a wizard - or a UNK i hope not said sam i dont want to be neither in the afternoon they went on down the woods they were probably following the very track that gandalf bilbo and the dwarves had used many years before after a few miles they came out on the top of a high bank above the road at this point the road had left the hoarwell far behind in its narrow valley and now UNK close to the feet of the hills rolling and winding eastward among woods and heather UNK slopes towards the ford and the mountains not far down the bank strider pointed out a stone in the grass on it UNK cut and now much UNK could still be seen UNK and secret marks there said merry that must be the stone that marked the place where the trolls gold was hidden how much is left of bilbos share i wonder frodo frodo looked at the stone and wished that bilbo had brought home no treasure more perilous nor less easy to pan with none at all he said bilbo gave it all away he told me he did not feel it was really his as it came from UNK the road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening there was no sign of any other travellers to be seen as there was now no other possible course for them to take they climbed down the bank and turning left went off as fast as they could soon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light of the fast westering sun a cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains ahead they were beginning to look out for a place off the road where they could camp for the night when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into their hearts the noise of hoofs behind them they looked back but they could not see far because of the many UNK and UNK of the road as quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into the deep heather and UNK UNK on the slopes above until they came to a small patch of UNK UNK as they peered out from among the bushes they could see the road faint and grey in the failing light some thirty feel below them the sound of hoofs drew nearer they were going fast with a light UNK then faintly as if it was blown away from them by the breeze they seemed to catch a dim ringing as of small bells UNK that does not sound like a black riders horse said frodo listening intently the other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not but they all remained full of suspicion they had been in fear of pursuit for so long that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly but strider was now leaning forward stooped to the ground with a hand to his ear and a look of joy on his face the light faded and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly clearer and nearer now the bells UNK and UNK came the quick trotting feet suddenly into view below came a white horse gleaming in the shadows running swiftly in the dusk its UNK flickered and flashed as if it were studded with gems like living stars the riders cloak streamed behind him and his hood was thrown back his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed to frodo it appeared that a white light was shining through the form and UNK of the rider as if through a thin veil strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the road leaping with a cry through the heather but even before he had moved or called the rider had UNK in his horse and halted looking up towards the thicket where they stood when he saw strider he UNK and ran to meet him calling out ai UNK UNK dnadan UNK UNK his speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in their hearts the rider was of the elven-folk no others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear but there seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call and they saw that he was now speaking quickly and urgently to strider soon strider UNK to them and the hobbits left the bushes and hurried down to the road this is glorfindel who dwells in the house of elrond said strider UNK and well met at last said the elf-lord to frodo i was sent from rivendell to look for you we feared that you were in danger upon the road then gandalf has reached rivendell cried frodo UNK no he had not when i departed but that was nine days ago answered glorfindel elrond received news that troubled him some of my kindred journeying in your land beyond the UNK learned that things were amiss and sent messages as swiftly as they could they said that the nine were abroad and that you were astray bearing a great burden without UNK for gandalf had not returned there are few even in rivendell that can ride openly against the nine but such as there were elrond sent out north west and south it was thought that you might turn far aside to avoid pursuit and become lost in the wilderness it was my lot to take the road and i came to the bridge of UNK and left a token there nigh on seven days ago three of the servants of sauron were upon the bridge but they UNK and i pursued them westward i came also upon two others but they turned away southward since then i have searched for your trail two days ago i found it and followed it over the bridge and today i marked where you descended from the hills again but come there is no time for further news since you are here we must risk the peril of the road and go there are five behind us and when they find your trail upon the road they will ride after us like the wind and they are not all where the other four may be i do not know i fear that we may find the ford is already held against us while glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened frodo felt a great weariness come over him ever since the sun began to sink the mist before his eyes had darkened and he felt that a shadow was coming between him and the faces of his friends now pain assailed him and he felt cold he swayed clutching at sams arm my master is UNK and UNK said sam UNK he cant go on riding after nightfall he needs rest glorfindel caught frodo as he sank to the ground and taking him gently in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety briefly strider told of the attack on their camp under weathertop and of the deadly knife he drew out the hilt which he had kept and handed it to the elf glorfindel shuddered as he took it but he looked intently at it there are evil things written on this hilt he said though maybe your eyes cannot see them keep it aragorn till we reach the house of elrond but be wary and handle it as little as you may alas the UNK of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal i will do what i can - but all the more do i UNK you now to go on without rest he searched the wound on frodos shoulder with his fingers and his face grew UNK as if what he learned UNK him but frodo felt the chill UNK in his side and arm a little UNK crept down from his shoulder to his hand and the pain grew easier the dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about him as if a cloud had been withdrawn he saw his friends faces more clearly again and a measure of new hope and strength returned you shall ride my horse said glorfindel i will UNK the UNK up to the UNK and you must sit as tight as you can but you need not fear my horse will not let any rider fall that i command him to bear his pace is light and smooth and if danger UNK too near he will bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy cannot UNK no he will not said frodo i shall not ride him if i am to be carried off to rivendell or anywhere else leaving my friends behind in danger glorfindel smiled i doubt very much he said if your friends would be in danger if you were not with them the pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace i think it is you frodo and that which you bear that brings us all in peril to that frodo had no answer and he was UNK to mount UNK white horse the pony was laden instead with a great part of the others burdens so that they now marched lighter and for a time made good speed but the hobbits began to find it hard to keep up with the swift UNK feet of the elf on he led them into the mouth of darkness and still on under the deep clouded night there was neither star nor moon not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to halt pippin merry and sam were by that time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs and even strider seemed by the UNK of his shoulders to be weary frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream they cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the UNK and fell asleep immediately they seemed hardly to have closed their eyes when glorfindel who had set himself to watch while they slept awoke them again the sun had now climbed far into the morning and the clouds and mists of the night were gone drink this said glorfindel to them pouring for each in turn a little UNK from his UNK UNK of leather it was clear as spring water and had no UNK and it did not feel either cool or warm in the mouth but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as they drank it eaten after that draught the UNK bread and UNK UNK which was now all that they had left seemed to UNK their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the shire had done they had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the road again glorfindel still urged them on and only allowed two brief UNK during the days march in this way they covered almost twenty miles before nightfall and came to a point where the road bent right and ran down towards the bottom of the valley now making straight for the bruinen so far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear but often glorfindel would halt and listen for a moment if they UNK behind and a look of anxiety clouded his face once or twice he spoke to strider in the UNK but however anxious their UNK might be it was plain that the hobbits could go no further that night they were stumbling along UNK with weariness and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs frodos pain had UNK and during the day things about him faded to shadows of UNK grey he almost welcomed the coming of night for then the world seemed less pale and empty the hobbits were still weary when they set out again early next morning there were many miles yet to go between them and the ford and they UNK forward at the best pace they could manage our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river said glorfindel for my heart UNK me that the pursuit is now swift behind us and other danger may be waiting by the ford the road was still running steadily downhill and there was now in places much grass at either side in which the hobbits walked when they could to ease their tired feet in the late afternoon they came to a place where the road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall UNK and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep UNK walls of red stone echoes ran along as they hurried forward and there seemed to be a sound of many UNK following their own all at once as if through a gate of light the road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open there at the bottom of a sharp UNK they saw before them a long flat mile and beyond that the ford of rivendell on the further side was a steep brown bank UNK by a winding path and behind that the tall mountains climbed shoulder above shoulder and peak beyond peak into the fading sky there was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind them a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through the branches of the UNK one moment glorfindel turned and listened then he sprang forward with a loud cry fly he called fly the enemy is upon us the white horse leaped forward the hobbits ran down the slope glorfindel and strider followed as rear UNK they were only half way across the flat when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping out of the gate in the trees that they had just left rode a black rider he UNK his horse in and halted UNK in his saddle another followed him and then another then again two more ride forward ride cried glorfindel to frodo he did not UNK at once for a strange UNK seized him UNK the horse to a walk he turned and looked back the riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like threatening UNK upon a hill dark and solid while all the woods and land about them UNK as if into a mist suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to wait then at once fear and hatred awoke in him his hand left the UNK and gripped the hilt of his sword and with a red flash he drew it ride on ride on cried glorfindel and then loud and clear he called to the horse in the UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK at once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the road at the same moment the black horses leaped down the hill in pursuit and from the riders came a terrible cry such as frodo had heard filling the woods with horror in the eastfarthing far away it was answered and to the dismay of frodo and his friends out from the trees and rocks away on the left four other riders came flying two rode towards frodo two galloped UNK towards the ford to cut off his escape they seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker as their courses UNK with his frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder he could no longer see his friends the riders behind were falling back even their great steeds were no match in speed for the white elf-horse of glorfindel he looked forward again and hope faded there seemed no chance of UNK the ford before he was cut off by the others that had lain in UNK he could see them clearly now they appeared to have cast aside their UNK and black cloaks and they were UNK in white and grey swords were naked in their pale hands UNK were on their heads their cold eyes glittered and they called to him with fell voices fear now filled all frodos mind he thought no longer of his sword no cry came from him he shut his eyes and UNK to the horses UNK the wind whistled in his ears and the bells upon the UNK rang wild and shrill a breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear as with a last UNK like a flash of white fire the elf-horse UNK as if on wings passed right before the face of the UNK rider frodo heard the splash of water it UNK about his feet he felt the quick UNK and UNK as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony path he was climbing the steep bank he was across the ford but the pursuers were close behind at the top of the bank the horse halted and turned about UNK fiercely there were nine riders at the waters edge below and frodos spirit UNK before the threat of their UNK faces he knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as easily as he had done and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over the long UNK path from the ford to the edge of rivendell if once the riders crossed in any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt hatred again stirred in him but he had no longer the strength to refuse suddenly the UNK rider UNK his horse forward it UNK at the water and reared up with a great effort frodo sat UNK and UNK his sword go back he cried go back to the land of mordor and follow me no more  his voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears the riders halted but frodo had not the power of bombadil his enemies laughed at him with a harsh and UNK laughter come back come back they called to mordor we will take you go back he whispered the ring the ring they cried with deadly voices and immediately their leader urged his horse forward into the water followed closely by two others by elbereth and lthien the fair said frodo with a last effort lifting up his sword you shall have neither the ring nor me then the leader who was now half across the ford stood up menacing in his UNK and raised up his hand frodo was UNK UNK he felt his tongue UNK to his mouth and his heart UNK his sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand the elf-horse reared and snorted the UNK of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore at that moment there came a roaring and a rushing a noise of loud waters rolling many stones dimly frodo saw the river below him rise and down along its course there came a UNK UNK of waves white flames seemed to frodo to UNK on their UNK and he half UNK that he saw amid the water white riders upon white horses with UNK UNK the three riders that were still in the midst of the ford were UNK they disappeared buried suddenly under angry foam those that were behind drew back in dismay with his last failing senses frodo heard cries and it seemed to him that he saw beyond the riders that hesitated on the shore a shining figure of white light and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames that flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world the black horses were filled with madness and leaping forward in terror they bore their riders into the rushing flood their piercing cries were drowned in the roaring of the river as it carried them away then frodo felt himself falling and the roaring and UNK seemed to rise and UNK him together with his enemies he heard and saw no more  book UNK  chapter   many UNK frodo woke and found himself lying in bed at first he thought that he had slept late after a long unpleasant dream that still UNK on the edge of memory or perhaps he had been ill but the UNK looked strange it was flat and it had dark UNK UNK carved he lay a little while longer looking at patches of sunlight on the wall and listening to the sound of a UNK where am i and what is the time he said aloud to the UNK in the house of elrond and it is ten oclock in the morning said a voice it is the morning of october the twenty UNK if you want to know gandalf cried frodo sitting up there was the old wizard sitting in a chair by the open window yes he said i am here and you are lucky to be here too after all the absurd things you have done since you left home frodo lay down again he felt too comfortable and peaceful to UNK and in any case he did not think he would get the better of an UNK he was fully awake now and the memory of his journey was returning the UNK short cut through the old forest the accident at the prancing pony  and his madness in putting on the ring in the dell under weathertop while he was thinking of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his UNK in rivendell there was a long silence broken only by the soft UNK of gandalf s pipe as he blew white smoke UNK out of the window wheres sam frodo asked at length and are the others all right yes they are all safe and sound answered gandalf sam was here until i sent him off to get some rest about half an hour ago what happened at the ford said frodo it all seemed so dim somehow and it still does yes it would you were beginning to fade answered gandalf the wound was UNK you at last a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid but you have some strength in you my dear hobbit as you showed in the barrow that was touch and go perhaps the most dangerous moment of all i wish you could have held out at weathertop you seem to know a great deal already said frodo i have not spoken to the others about the barrow at first it was too horrible and afterwards there were other things to think about how do you know about it you have talked long in your sleep frodo said gandalf gently and it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory do not worry though i said absurd just now i did not mean it i think well of UNK of the others it is no small UNK to have come so far and through such dangers still bearing the ring we should never have done it without strider said frodo but we needed you i did not know what to do without you i was delayed said gandalf and that nearly proved our ruin and yet i am not sure it may have been better so i wish you would tell me what happened all in good time you are not supposed to talk or worry about anything today by elronds orders but talking would stop me thinking and wondering which are quite as tiring said frodo i am wide awake now and i remember so many things that want UNK why were you delayed you ought to tell me that at least you will soon hear all you wish to know said gandalf we shall have a council as soon as you are well enough at the moment i will only say that i was held UNK you cried frodo yes i gandalf the grey said the wizard solemnly there are many powers in the world for good or for evil some are greater than i am against some i have not yet been UNK but my time is coming the UNK and his black riders have come forth war is UNK then you knew of the riders already UNK i met them yes i knew of them indeed i spoke of them once to you for the black riders are the ringwraiths the nine servants of the lord of the rings but i did not know that they had arisen again or i should have fled with you at once i heard news of them only after i left you in june but that story must wait for the moment we have been saved from disaster by aragorn yes said frodo it was strider that saved us yet i was afraid of him at first sam never quite trusted him i think not at any rate until we met glorfindel gandalf smiled v i have heard all about sam he said he has no more doubts now i am glad said frodo for i have become very fond of strider well fond is not the right word i mean he is dear to me though he is strange and grim at times in fact he UNK me often of you i didnt know that any of the big people were like that i thought well that they were just big and rather stupid kind and stupid like butterbur or stupid and wicked like bill ferny but then we dont know much about men in the shire except perhaps the UNK you dont know much even about them if you think old barliman is stupid said gandalf he is wise enough on his own ground he UNK less than he talks and slower yet he can see through a brick wall in time as they say in bree but there are few left in middle-earth like aragorn son of arathorn the race of the kings from over the sea is nearly at an end it may be that this war of the ring will be their last adventure do you really mean that strider is one of the people of the old kings said frodo in wonder i thought they had all vanished long ago i thought he was only a ranger only a ranger cried gandalf my dear frodo that is just what the rangers are the last remnant in the north of the great people the men of the west they have helped me before and i shall need their help in the days to come for we have reached rivendell but the ring is not yet at rest i suppose not said frodo but so far my only thought has been to get here and i hope i shant have to go any further it is very pleasant just to rest i have had a month of exile and adventure and i find that has been as much as i want he fell silent and shut his eyes after a while he spoke again i have been reckoning he said and i cant bring the UNK up to october the UNK it ought to be the UNK we must have reached the ford by the UNK you have talked and reckoned more than is good for you said gandalf how do the side and shoulder feel now i dont know frodo answered they dont feel at all which is an UNK but he made an effort i can move my arm again a little yes it is coming back to life it is not cold he added UNK his left hand with his right good said gandalf it is UNK fast you will soon be sound again elrond has cured you he has tended you for days ever since you were brought in days said frodo well four nights and three days to be UNK the elves brought you from this where you lost count we have been terribly anxious and sam has hardly left your side day or night except to run messages elrond is a master of healing but the weapons of our enemy are deadly to tell you the truth i had very little hope for i UNK that there was some UNK of the blade still in the closed wound but it could not be found until last night then elrond removed a UNK it was deeply buried and it was UNK inwards frodo shuddered remembering the cruel knife with UNK blade that had vanished in striders hands dont be alarmed said gandalf it is gone now it has been melted and it seems that hobbits fade very reluctantly i have known strong UNK of the big people who would quickly have been overcome by that UNK which you bore for UNK days what would they have done to me asked frodo what were the riders trying to do they tried to pierce your heart with a UNK which remains in the wound if they had UNK you would have become like they are only UNK and under their command you would have became a UNK under the dominion of the dark lord and he would have UNK you for trying to keep his ring if any greater torment were possible than being UNK of it and seeing it on his hand thank UNK i did not UNK the horrible danger said frodo faintly i was UNK afraid of course but if i had known more i should not have dared even to move it is a UNK that i escaped yes fortune or fate have helped you said gandalf not to mention courage for your heart was not touched and only your shoulder was pierced and that was because you UNK to the last but it was a terribly narrow UNK so to speak you were in UNK peril while you wore the ring for then you were half in the UNK world yourself and they might have seized you you could see them and they could see you i know said frodo they were terrible to behold but why could we all see their horses because they are real horses just as the black robes are real robes that they wear to give shape to their UNK when they have dealings with the living then why do these black horses endure such riders all other UNK are terrified when they draw near even the elf-horse of glorfindel the dogs UNK and the UNK UNK at them because these horses are born and UNK to the service of the dark lord in mordor not all his servants and UNK are UNK there are ores and trolls there are UNK and UNK and there have been and still are many men UNK and kings that walk alive under the sun and yet are under his sway and their number is growing UNK what about rivendell and the elves is rivendell safe yes at present until all else is UNK the elves may fear the dark lord and they may fly before him but never again will they listen to him or serve him and here in rivendell there live still some of his chief foes the UNK lords of the UNK from beyond the UNK seas they do not fear the ringwraiths for those who have dwelt in the blessed realm live at once in both UNK and against both the seen and the unseen they have great power i thought that i saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim like the others was that glorfindel then yes you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side one of the mighty of the UNK lie is an elf-lord of a house of UNK indeed there is a power in rivendell to withstand the might of mordor for a while and elsewhere other powers still dwell there is power too of another kind in the shire but all such places will soon become UNK under UNK if things go on as they are going the dark lord is putting forth all his strength still he said standing suddenly up and UNK out his chin while his beard went stiff and straight like bristling UNK we must keep up our courage you will soon be well if i do not talk you to death you are in rivendell and you need not worry about anything for the present i havent any courage to keep up said frodo but i am not worried at the moment just give me news of my friends and tell me the end of the affair at the ford as i keep on asking and i shall be content for the present after that i shall have another sleep i think but i shant be able to close my eyes until you have finished the story for me gandalf moved his chair to the UNK and took a good look at frodo the colour had come back to his face and his eyes were clear and fully awake and aware he was smiling and there seemed to be little wrong with him but to the wizards eye there was a faint change just a hint as it were of UNK about him and especially about the left hand that lay outside upon the UNK still that must be expected said gandalf to himself he is not half through yet and to what he will come in the end not even elrond can UNK not to evil i think he may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can you look splendid he said aloud i will risk a brief tale without UNK elrond but quite brief mind you and then you must sleep again this is what happened as far as i can gather the riders made straight for you as soon as you fled they did not need the UNK of their horses any longer you had become visible to them being already on the threshold of their world and also the ring drew them your friends sprang aside off the road or they would have been ridden down they knew that nothing could save you if the white horse could not the riders were too swift to UNK and too many to UNK on foot even glorfindel and aragorn together could not with stand all the nine at once when the ring UNK swept by your friends ran up behind close to the ford there is a small hollow beside the road UNK by a few UNK trees there they hastily kindled fire for glorfindel knew that a flood would come down if the riders tried to cross and then he would have to deal with any that were left on his side of the river the moment the flood appeared he rushed out followed by aragorn and the others with UNK UNK caught between fire and water and seeing an elf-lord revealed in his wrath they were dismayed and their horses were UNK with madness three were carried away by the first UNK of the flood the others were now hurled into the water by their horses and UNK and is that the end of the black riders asked frodo no said gandalf their horses must have perished and without them they are UNK but the ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyed however there is nothing more to fear from them at present your friends crossed after the flood had passed and they found you lying on your face at the top of the bank with a broken sword under you the horse was standing guard beside you you were pale and cold and they feared that you were dead or worse elronds folk met them carrying you slowly towards ri vendell  who made the flood asked frodo elrond commanded it answered gandalf the river of this valley is under his power and it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the ford as soon as the captain of the ringwraiths rode into the water the flood was released if i may say so i added a few UNK of my own you may not have noticed but some of the waves took the form of great white horses with shining white riders and there were many rolling and UNK UNK for a moment i was afraid that we had let loose too fierce a wrath and the flood would get out of hand and UNK you all away there is great vigour in the waters that come down from the UNK of the misty mountains yes it all comes back to me now said frodo the UNK roaring i thought i was UNK with my friends and enemies and all but now we are safe gandalf looked quickly at frodo but he had shut his eyes yes you are all safe for the present soon there will be UNK and merrymaking to UNK the victory at the ford of bruinen and you will all be there in places of honour splendid said frodo it is wonderful that elrond and glorfindel and such great lords not to mention strider should take so much trouble and show me so much kindness well there are many UNK why they should said gandalf smiling i am one good reason the ring is another you are the ring-bearer and you are the heir of bilbo the UNK dear bilbo said frodo UNK i wonder where he is i wish he was here and could hear all about it it would have made him laugh the cow jumped over the moon and the poor old troll with that he fell fast asleep frodo was now safe in the fast UNK house east of the sea that house was as bilbo had long ago reported a perfect house whether you like food or sleep or UNK or singing or just sitting and thinking best or a pleasant UNK of them all merely to be there was a cure for weariness fear and UNK as the evening drew on frodo woke up again and he found that he no longer felt in need of rest or sleep but had a mind for food and drink and probably for singing and UNK afterwards he got out of bed and discovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had been he found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that UNK him UNK looking in a mirror he was startled to see a much thinner UNK of himself than he remembered it looked UNK like the young nephew of bilbo who used to go tramping with his uncle in the shire but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully yes you have seen a thing or two since you last UNK out of a UNK he said to his UNK but now for a merry meeting he stretched out his arms and whistled a tune at that moment there was a knock on the door and sam came in he ran to frodo and took his left hand UNK and UNK he UNK it gently and then he UNK and turned hastily away hullo sam said frodo its warm said sam meaning your hand mr frodo it has felt so cold through the long nights but UNK and UNK he cried turning round again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor its fine to see you up and yourself again sir gandalf asked me to come and see if you were ready to come down and i thought he was UNK i am ready said frodo lets go and look for the rest of the party i can take you to them sir said sam its a big house this and very peculiar always a bit more to discover and no knowing what youll find round a corner and elves sir elves here and elves there some like kings terrible and splendid and some as merry as children and the music and the UNK that i have had the time or the heart for much listening since we got here but im getting to know some of the ways of the place i know what you have been doing sam said frodo taking his arm but you shall be merry tonight and listen to your hearts content come on guide me round the corners sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a high garden above the steep bank of the river he found his friends sitting in a porch on the side of the house looking east shadows had fallen in the valley below but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far above the air was warm the sound of running and falling water was loud and the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers as if summer still lingered in elronds gardens UNK cried pippin springing up here is our noble cousin make way for frodo lord of the ring hush said gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch evil things do not come into this valley but all the same we should not name them the lord of the ring is not frodo but the master of the dark tower of mordor whose power is again stretching out over the world we are sitting in a fortress outside it is getting dark gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that said pippin he UNK i need keeping in order but it seems impossible somehow to feel gloomy or UNK in this place i feel i could sing if i knew the right song for the occasion i feel like singing myself laughed frodo though at the moment i feel more like eating and drinking that will soon be cured said pippin you have shown your usual cunning in getting up just in time for a meal more than meal a feast said merry as soon as gandalf reported that you were UNK the preparations began he had hardly finished speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells the hall of elronds house was filled with folk elves for the most part though there were a few guests of other sorts elrond as was his custom sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the UNK and next to him on the one side sat glorfindel on the other side sat gandalf frodo looked at them in wonder for he had never before seen elrond of whom so many tales spoke and as they sat upon his right hand and his left glorfindel and even gandalf whom he thought he knew so well were revealed as lords of UNK and power gandalf was shorter in UNK than the other two but his long white hair his UNK silver beard and his broad shoulders made him look like some wise king of ancient legend in his UNK face under great UNK brows his dark eyes were set like UNK that could leap suddenly into fire glorfindel was tall and straight his hair was of shining gold his face fair and young and fearless and full of joy his eyes were bright and keen and his voice like music on his brow sat wisdom and in his hand was strength the face of elrond was UNK neither old nor young though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and UNK his hair was dark as the shadows of twilight and upon it was set a circlet of silver his eyes were grey as a clear evening and in them was a light like the light of stars UNK he seemed as a king crowned with many UNK and yet UNK as a tried UNK in the UNK of his strength he was the lord of rivendell and mighty among both elves and men in the middle of the table against the woven UNK upon the wall there was a chair under a UNK and there sat a lady fair to look upon and so like was she in form of UNK to elrond that frodo guessed that she was one of his close kindred young she was and yet not so the UNK of her dark hair were touched by no frost her white arms and clear face were UNK and smooth and the light of stars was in her bright eyes grey as a UNK night yet UNK she looked and thought and knowledge were in her glance as of one who has known many things that the years bring above her brow her head was covered with a UNK of silver UNK UNK with small gems glittering white but her soft grey UNK had no UNK save a UNK of leaves wrought in silver so it was that frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen arwen daughter of elrond in whom it was said that the UNK of lthien had come on earth again and she was called UNK for she was the UNK of her people long she had been in the land of her mothers kin in lurien beyond the mountains and was but lately returned to rivendell to her fathers house but her UNK UNK and UNK were out upon UNK for they rode often far UNK with the rangers of the north forgetting never their mothers torment in the UNK of the ores such UNK in living thing frodo had never seen before nor imagined in his mind and he was both surprised and UNK to find that he had a seat at elrond s table among all these folk so high and fair though he had a UNK chair and was raised upon several UNK he felt very small and rather out of place but that feeling quickly passed the feast was merry and the food all that his hunger could desire it was some time before he looked about him again or even turned to his UNK he looked first for his friends sam had begged to be allowed to wait on his master but had been told that for this time he was a guest of honour frodo could see him now sitting with pippin and merry at the upper end of one of the UNK close to the UNK he could see no sign of strider next to frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance UNK dressed his beard very long and UNK was white nearly as white as the snow-white cloth of his garments he wore a silver belt and round his neck hung a chain of silver and UNK frodo stopped eating to look at him welcome and well met said the dwarf turning towards him then he actually rose from his seat and bowed gluin at your service he said and bowed still lower frodo baggins at your service and your UNK said frodo UNK rising in surprise and UNK his UNK am i right in guessing that you are the gluin one of the twelve companions of the great thorin UNK shield quite right answered the dwarf gathering up the UNK and UNK UNK frodo back into his seat and i do not ask for i have already been told that you are the UNK and UNK heir of our friend bilbo the UNK allow me to UNK you on your UNK thank you very much said frodo you have had some very strange adventures i hear said gluin i wonder greatly what brings four hobbits on so long a journey nothing like it has happened since bilbo came with us but perhaps i should not UNK too closely since elrond and gandalf do not seem UNK to talk of this i think we will not speak of it at least not yet said frodo UNK he guessed that even in elronds house the matter of the ring was not one for UNK talk and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a time but i am UNK curious he added to learn what brings so important a dwarf so far from the lonely mountain gluin looked at him if you have not heard i think we will not speak yet of that either master elrond will UNK us all ere long i believe and then we shall all hear many things but there is much else that may be told UNK the rest of the meal they talked together but frodo listened more than he spoke for the news of the shire apart from the ring seemed small and UNK and UNK while gluin had much to tell of events in the northern regions of wilderland frodo learned that UNK the old son of UNK was now the lord of many sturdy men and to their land between the mountains and mirkwood neither ore nor wolf dared to go indeed said gluin if it were not for the beornings the passage from dale to rivendell would long ago have become impossible they are valiant men and keep open the high pass and the ford of UNK but their UNK are high he added with a shake of his head and like UNK of old they are not over fond of dwarves still they are UNK and that is much in these days nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the men of dale they are good folk the UNK the UNK of UNK the UNK rules them brand son of UNK son of UNK he is a strong king and his realm now reaches far south and east of UNK and what of your own people asked frodo there is much to tell good and bad said gluin yet it is mostly good we have so far been UNK though we do not escape the shadow of these times if you really wish to hear of us i will tell you tidings gladly but stop me when you are weary dwarves tongues run on when speaking of their UNK they say and with that gluin UNK on a long account of the doings of the UNK he was delighted to have found so polite a UNK for frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the UNK though actually he soon got rather lost among the strange names of people and places that he had never heard of before he was interested however to hear that dbin was still king under the mountain and was now old having passed his two hundred and fiftieth year UNK and UNK rich of the ten companions who had survived the battle of five armies seven were still with him UNK gluin UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK was now so fat that he could not move himself from his UNK to his chair at table and it took six young dwarves to UNK him and what has become of balin and UNK and uin asked frodo a shadow passed over UNK face we do not know he answered it is largely on account of balin that i have come to ask the advice of those that dwell in rivendell but tonight let us speak of UNK things gluin began then to talk of the works of his people telling frodo about their great labours in dale and under the mountain we have done well he said but in UNK we cannot UNK our fathers many of whose secrets are lost we make good UNK and keen swords but we cannot again make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon came only in UNK and building have we UNK the old days you should see the UNK of dale frodo and the fountains and the pools you should see the UNK roads of many colours and the halls and cavernous UNK under the earth with arches carved like trees and the UNK and towers upon the mountains sides then you would see that we have not been idle i will come and see them if ever i can said frodo how surprised bilbo would have been to see all the changes in the UNK of UNK gluin looked at frodo and smiled you were very fond of bilbo were you not he asked yes answered frodo  would rather see him than all the towers and UNK in the world at length the feast came to an end elrond and arwen rose and went down the hall and the company followed them in due order the doors were thrown open and they went across a wide passage and through other doors and came into a further hall in it were no tables but a bright fire was burning in a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side frodo found himself walking with gandalf this is the hall of fire said the wizard here you will hear many songs and UNK you can keep awake but except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet and people come here who wish for peace and thought there is always a fire here all the year round but there is little other light as elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for him elvish UNK began to make sweet music slowly the hall filled and frodo looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair suddenly he noticed not far from the further end of the fire a small dark figure seated on a UNK with his back UNK against a pillar beside him on the ground was a UNK and some bread frodo wondered whether he was ill if people were ever ill in ri vendell and had been unable to come to the feast his head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast and a fold of his dark cloak was drawn over his face elrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure awake little master he said with a smile then turning to frodo he UNK to him now at last the hour has come that you have wished for frodo he said here is a friend that you have long missed the dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face bilbo cried frodo with sudden UNK and he sprang forward hullo frodo my lad said bilbo so you have got here at last i hoped you would manage it well well so all this UNK is in your honour i hear i hope you enjoyed yourself why UNK you there cried frodo and why havent i been allowed to see you before because you were asleep i have seen a good deal of you i have sat by your side with sam each day but as for the feast i dont go in for such things much now and i had something else to do what were you doing why sitting and thinking i do a lot of that UNK and this is the best place to do it in as a rule wake up indeed he said UNK an eye at elrond there was a bright UNK in it and no sign of sleepiness that frodo could see wake up i was not asleep master elrond if you want to know you have all come out from your feast too soon and you have disturbed UNK the middle of making up a song i was stuck over a line or two and was thinking about them but now i dont suppose i shall ever get them right there will be such a deal of singing that the UNK will be driven clean out of my head i shall have to get my friend the dnadan to help me where is he elrond laughed he shall be found he said then you two shall go into a corner and finish your task and we will hear it and judge it before we end our merrymaking messengers were sent to find bilbos friend though none knew where he was or why he had not been present at the feast in the meanwhile frodo and bilbo sat side by side and sam came quickly and UNK himself near them they talked together in soft voices UNK of the UNK and music in the hall about them bilbo had not much to say of himself when he had left hobbiton he had wandered off UNK along the road or in the country on either side but somehow he had steered all the time towards ri vendell i got here without much adventure he said and after a rest i went on with the dwarves to dale my last journey i shant travel again old balin had gone away then i came back here and here i have been i have done this and that i have written some more of my book and of course i make up a few songs they sing them occasionally just to please me i think for of course they arent really good enough for rivendell and i listen and i think time doesnt seem to pass here it just is a remarkable place altogether i hear all kinds of news from over the mountains and out of the south but hardly anything from the shire i heard about the ring of course gandalf has been here often not that he has told me a great deal he has become closer than ever these last few years the dnadan has told me more fancy that ring of mine UNK such a UNK it is a pity that gandalf did not find out more sooner i could have brought the thing here myself long ago without so much trouble i have thought several times of going back to hobbiton for it but i am getting old and they would not let me gandalf and elrond i mean they seemed to think that the enemy was looking high and low for me and would make UNK of me if he caught me UNK about in the wild and gandalf said the ring has passed on bilbo it would do no good to you or to others if you tried to UNK with it again odd sort of remark just like gandalf but he said he was looking after you so i let things be i am UNK glad to see you safe and sound he paused and looked at frodo doubtfully have you got it here he asked in a whisper i cant help feeling curious you know after all ive heard i should very much like just to UNK at it again yes ive got it answered frodo feeling a strange UNK it looks just the same as ever it did well i should just like to see it for a moment said bilbo when he had dressed frodo found that while he slept the ring had been hung about his neck on a new chain light but strong slowly he drew it out bilbo put out his hand but frodo quickly drew back the ring to his UNK and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at bilbo a shadow seemed to have fallen between them and through it he found himself UNK a little UNK creature with a hungry face and UNK groping hands he felt a desire to strike him the music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell bilbo looked quickly at frodos face and passed his hand across his eyes i understand now he said put it away i am sorry sorry you have come in for this burden sorry about everything dont adventures ever have an end i suppose not someone else always has to carry on the story well it cant be helped i wonder if its any good trying to finish my book but dont lets worry about it UNK have some real news tell me all about the shire frodo hid the ring away and the shadow passed leaving hardly a UNK of memory the light and music of rivendell was about him again bilbo smiled and laughed happily every item of news from the shire that frodo could UNK and UNK now and again by UNK of the greatest interest to him from the UNK of the least tree to the UNK of the UNK child in hobbiton they were so deep in the doings of the four farthings that they did not notice the arrival of a man clad in dark green cloth for many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile suddenly bilbo looked up ah there you are at last dnadan he cried strider said frodo you seem to have a lot of names well strider is one that i havent heard before anyway said bilbo what do you call him that for they call me that in bree said strider laughing and that is how i was introduced to him and why do you call him dnadan asked frodo  the dnadan said bilbo fie is often called that here but i thought you knew enough elvish at least to know UNK man of the west UNK but this is not the time for UNK he turned to strider where have you been my friend why UNK you at the feast the UNK arwen was there strider looked down at bilbo gravely i know he said but often i must put UNK aside UNK and UNK have returned out of the wild UNK and they had tidings that i wished to hear at once well my dear fellow said bilbo now youve heard the news cant you spare me a moment i want your help in something UNK elrond says this song of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening and i am stuck UNK go off into a corner and UNK it up strider smiled come then he said UNK me hear it frodo was left to himself for a while for sam had fallen asleep he was alone and felt rather UNK although all about him the folk of rivendell were gathered but those near him were silent UNK upon the music of the voices and the UNK and they gave no heed to anything else frodo began to listen at first the beauty of the UNK and of the UNK words in UNK even though he understood them little held him in a spell as soon as he began to UNK to them almost it seemed that the words took shape and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him and the UNK hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the UNK of the world then the UNK became more and more UNK until he felt that an endless river of UNK gold and silver was flowing over him too UNK for its UNK to be UNK it became part of the UNK air about him and it UNK and drowned him swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of sleep there he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running water and then suddenly into a voice it seemed to be the voice of bilbo UNK verses faint at first and then clearer ran the words edrendil was a UNK that UNK in UNK he built a boat of UNK UNK in UNK to journey in her UNK he UNK of silver fair of silver were her lanterns made her UNK was UNK like a swan and light upon her UNK laid in UNK of ancient kings in chain UNK rings he UNK him his shining shield was scored with runes to UNK all UNK and harm from him his bow was made of UNK his arrows UNK of UNK of silver was his UNK his UNK of UNK his sword of steel was valiant of UNK his UNK tall an UNK upon his UNK upon his breast an UNK beneath the moon and under star he wandered far from northern strands UNK on enchanted ways beyond the days of mortal lands from UNK of the narrow UNK where shadow lies on frozen hills from UNK UNK and burning waste he turned in haste and UNK still on UNK waters far astray at last he came to night of naught and passed and never sight he saw of shining shore nor light he sought the winds of wrath came driving him and blindly in the foam he fled from west to east and UNK UNK he UNK sped there flying UNK came to him and flame was in the darkness lit more bright than light of UNK the fire upon her UNK the UNK she bound on him and crowned him with the living light and UNK then with burning brow he turned his UNK and in the night from UNK beyond the sea there strong and free a storm arose a wind of power in UNK by paths that seldom mortal goes his boat it bore with biting breath as might of death across the grey and UNK seas UNK from east to west he passed away through UNK he back was borne on black and roaring waves that ran UNK leagues UNK and UNK shores that drowned before the days began until he heard on strands of pearl when ends the world the music long where ever foaming UNK roll the yellow gold and jewels UNK he saw the mountain silent rise where twilight lies upon the knees of UNK and UNK beheld afar beyond the seas a UNK escaped from night to UNK white he came at last to UNK the green and fair where keen the air where pale as glass beneath the hill of UNK UNK in a valley sheer the UNK towers UNK are mirrored on the UNK he UNK there from UNK and UNK they taught to him and UNK old him UNK told and UNK of gold they brought to him they clothed him then in UNK and seven lights before him sent as through the UNK to hidden land UNK he went he came UNK the UNK halls where shining fall the countless years and endless UNK the elder king in UNK on mountain sheer and words UNK were spoken then of folk of men and UNK beyond the world were visions showed UNK to those that dwell UNK a ship then new they built for him of mithril and of UNK with shining UNK no shaven UNK nor sail she bore on silver UNK the UNK as lantern light and UNK bright with living flame to gleam UNK by elbereth herself was set who thither came and wings UNK made for him and laid on him UNK doom to sail the UNK UNK and come behind the sun and light of moon from UNK lofty hills where softly silver fountains fall his wings him bore a wandering light beyond the mighty mountain wall from UNK end then he turned away and UNK again to find afar his home through shadows journeying and burning as an island star on high above the mists he came a distant flame before the sun a wonder ere the waking dawn where grey the UNK waters run and over middle-earth he passed and heard at last the weeping UNK of UNK and of UNK in elder days in years of UNK UNK on him mighty doom was laid till moon should fade an UNK star to pass and UNK never more on hither shores where mortals are for ever still a UNK on an errand that should never rest to bear his shining lamp afar the UNK of westernesse the UNK ceased frodo opened his eyes and saw that bilbo was seated on his UNK in a circle of UNK who were smiling and UNK now we had better have it again said an elf bilbo got up and bowed i am UNK UNK he said but it would be too tiring to repeat it all not too tiring for you the elves answered laughing you know you are never tired of UNK your own verses but really we cannot answer your question at one hearing what cried bilbo you cant tell which parts were mine and which were the UNK it is not easy for us to tell the UNK between two mortals said the elf nonsense UNK snorted bilbo if you cant UNK between a man and a hobbit your UNK is UNK than i imagined theyre as different as UNK and apples maybe to sheep other sheep no doubt appear different laughed UNK or to UNK but mortals have not been our study we have other business i wont UNK with you said bilbo i am sleepy after so much music and singing ill leave you to guess if you want to he got up and came towards frodo well thats over he said in a low voice it went off better than i expected i dont often get asked for a second hearing what did you think of it i am not going to try and guess said frodo smiling you UNK said bilbo as a matter of fact it was all mine except that aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone he seemed to think it important i dont know why otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing rather above my head and he said that if i had the UNK to make verses about edrendil in the house of elrond it was my affair i suppose he was right i dont know said frodo it seemed to me to fit somehow though i cant explain i was half asleep when you began and it seemed to follow on from something that i was dreaming about i didnt understand that it was really you speaking until near the end it is difficult to keep awake here until you get used to it said bilbo not that hobbits would ever UNK quite the elvish UNK for music and poetry and tales they seem to like them as much as food or more they will be going on for a long time yet what do you say to slipping off for some more quiet talk can we said frodo of course this is merrymaking not business come and go as you like as long as you dont make a noise they got up and UNK quietly into the shadows and made for the doors sam they left behind fast asleep still with a smile on his face in spite of his delight in bilbos company frodo felt a UNK of regret as they passed out of the hall of fire even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice rose in song a elbereth gilthoniel UNK UNK UNK o UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK o UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK frodo halted for a moment looking back elrond was in his chair and the fire was on his face like summer UNK upon the trees near him sat the lady arwen to his surprise frodo saw that aragorn stood beside her his dark cloak was thrown back and he seemed to be clad in UNK and a star shone on his breast they spoke together and then suddenly it seemed to frodo that arwen turned towards him and the light of her eyes fell on him from afar and pierced his heart he stood still enchanted while the sweet UNK of the elvish song fell like clear jewels of UNK word and UNK  it is a song to elbereth said bilbo they will sing that and other songs of the blessed realm many times tonight come on he led frodo back to his own little room it opened on to the UNK UNK and looked south across the ravine of the bruinen there they sat for some while looking through the window at the bright stars above the UNK woods and talking softly they spoke no more of the small news of the shire far away nor of the dark shadows and perils that UNK them but of the fair things they had seen in the world together of the elves of the stars of trees and the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods at last there came a knock on the door begging your pardon said sam putting in his head but i was just wondering if you would be wanting anything and begging yours sam gamgee replied bilbo i guess you mean that it is time your master went to bed well sir there is a council early tomorrow i hear and he only got up today for the first time quite right sam laughed bilbo you can UNK off and tell gandalf that he has gone to bed good night frodo bless me but it has been good to see you again there are no folk like hobbits after all for a real good talk i am getting very old and i began to wonder if i should ever live to see your chapters of our story good night ill take a walk i think and look at the stars of elbereth in the garden sleep well chapter   the council of elrond next day frodo woke early feeling refreshed and well he walked along the UNK above the UNK bruinen and watched the pale cool sun rise above the far mountains and shine down slanting through the thin silver mist the dew upon the yellow leaves was glimmering and the woven UNK of UNK twinkled on every UNK sam walked beside him saying nothing but sniffing the air and looking every now and again with wonder in his eyes at the great heights in the east the snow was white upon their peaks on a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon gandalf and bilbo deep in talk hullo good morning said bilbo feel ready for the great council i feel ready for anything answered frodo but most of all i should like to go walking today and UNK the valley i should like to get into those UNK woods up there he pointed away far up the side of rivendell to the north you may have a chance later said gandalf but we cannot make any plans yet there is much to hear and decide today suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out that is the warning bell for the council of elrond cried gandalf come along now both you and bilbo are wanted frodo and bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back to the house behind them UNK and for the moment forgotten trotted sam gandalf led them to the porch where frodo had found his friends the evening before the light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the valley the noise of bubbling waters came up from the foaming UNK birds were singing and a wholesome peace lay on the land to frodo his dangerous flight and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world outside already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream but the faces that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave elrond was there and several others were seated in silence about him frodo saw glorfindel and gluin and in a corner alone strider was sitting clad in his old UNK clothes again elrond drew frodo to a seat by his side and UNK him to the company saying here my friends is the hobbit frodo son of drogo few have ever come hither through greater peril or on an errand more UNK he then pointed out and named those whom frodo had not met before there was a younger dwarf at UNK side his son gimli beside glorfindel there were several other UNK of elronds household of whom erestor was the chief and with him was galdor an elf from the grey havens who had come on an errand from UNK the UNK there was also a strange elf clad in green and brown legolas a messenger from his father UNK the king of the elves of northern mirkwood and seated a little apart was a tall man with a fair and noble face UNK and UNK proud and stern of glance he was cloaked and UNK as if for a journey on UNK and indeed though his garments were rich and his cloak was lined with UNK they were stained with long travel he had a UNK of silver in which a single white stone was set his UNK were UNK about his shoulders on a UNK he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees he gazed at frodo and bilbo with sudden wonder here said elrond turning to gandalf is boromir a man from the south he arrived in the grey morning and UNK for counsel i have UNK him to be present for here his questions will be answered not all that was spoken and UNK in the council need now be told much was said of events in the world outside especially in the south and in the wide lands east of the mountains of these things frodo had already heard many rumours but the tale of gluin was new to him and when the dwarf spoke he listened UNK it appeared that amid the splendour of their works of hand the hearts of the dwarves of the lonely mountain were troubled it is now many years ago said gluin that a shadow of UNK fell upon our people whence it came we did not at first perceive words began to be whispered in UNK it was said that we were UNK in a narrow place and that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world some spoke of moria the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own tongue khazad-dym and they declared that now at last we had the power and numbers to return gluin sighed moria moria wonder of the northern world too deep we UNK there and woke the nameless fear long have its vast UNK lain empty since the children of durin fled but now we spoke of it again with longing and yet with dread for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of khazad-dym for many lives of kings save thrur only and he perished at last however balin listened to the whispers and UNK to go and though dbin did not give leave willingly he took with him UNK and uin and many of our folk and they went away south that was nigh on thirty years ago for a while we had news and it seemed good messages reported that moria had been entered and a great work begun there then there was silence and no word has ever come from moria since then about a year ago a messenger came to dbin but not from moria UNK mordor a horseman in the night who called dbin to his gate the lord sauron the great so he said wished for our friendship rings he would give for it such as he gave of old and he asked urgently concerning hobbits of what kind they were and where they dwelt for sauron knows said he that one of these was known to you on a time at this we were greatly troubled and we gave no answer and then his fell voice was UNK and he would have UNK it if he could as a small token only of your friendship sauron UNK this he said that you should find this thief such was his word and get from him willing or no a little ring the least of rings that once he stole it is but a UNK that sauron UNK and an UNK of your good will find it and three rings that the dwarf UNK possessed of old shall be returned to you and the realm of moria shall be yours for ever find only news of the thief whether he still lives and where and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the lord refuse and things will not seem so well do you refuse at that his breath came like the hiss of snakes and all who stood by shuddered but dbin said i say neither UNK nor nay i must consider this message and what it means under its fair cloak  consider well but not too long said he  the time of my thought is my own to spend answered dbin  for the present said he and rode into the darkness heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night we needed not the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that his words held both UNK and UNK for we knew already that the power that has UNK mordor has not changed and ever it betrayed us of old twice the messenger has returned and has gone UNK the third and last time so he says is soon to come before the ending of the year and so i have been sent at last by dbin to warn bilbo that he is sought by the enemy and to learn if may be why he desires this ring this least of rings also we UNK the advice of elrond for the shadow grows and draws nearer we discover that messengers have come also to king brand in dale and that he is afraid we fear that he may yield already war is gathering on his eastern borders if we make no answer the enemy may move men of his rule to UNK king brand and dbin also you have done well to come said elrond you will hear today all that you need in order to understand the purposes of the enemy there is naught that you can do other than to resist with hope or without it but you do not stand alone you will learn that your trouble is but part of the trouble of all the western world the ring  what shall we do with the ring the least of rings the UNK that sauron UNK that is the doom that we must deem that is the purpose for which you are called hither called i say though i have not called you to me strangers from distant lands you have come and are here met in this very UNK of time by chance as it may seem yet it is not so believe rather that it is so ordered that we who sit here and none others must now find counsel for the peril of the world now therefore things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden from all but a few until this day and first so that all may understand what is the peril the tale of the ring shall be told from the beginning even to this present and i will begin that tale though others shall end it then all listened while elrond in his clear voice spoke of sauron and the rings of power and their UNK in the second age of the world long ago a part of his tale was known to some there but the full tale to none and many eyes were turned t elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the UNK of eregion and their friendship with moria and their UNK for knowledge by which sauron UNK them for in that time he was not yet evil to behold and they received his aid and grew mighty in craft UNK he learned all their secrets and betrayed them and forged secretly in the mountain of fire the one ring to be their master but UNK was aware of him and hid the three which he had made and there was war and the land was laid waste and the gate of moria was shut then through all the years that followed he UNK the ring but since that history is elsewhere recounted even as elrond himself set it down in his books of lore it is not here recalled for it is a long tale full of deeds great and terrible and briefly though elrond spoke the sun rode up the sky and the morning was passing ere he ceased of nmenor he spoke its UNK and its fall and the return of the kings of men to middle-earth out of the deeps of the sea borne upon the wings of storm then elendil the tall and his mighty sons isildur and anbrion became great lords and the UNK they made in arnor and the UNK in gondor above the mouths of anduin but sauron of mordor assailed them and they made the last UNK of elves and men and the hosts of gil-galad and elendil were UNK in arnor UNK elrond paused a while and sighed i remember well the splendour of their UNK he said v it recalled to me the UNK of the elder days and the hosts of UNK so many great UNK and UNK were UNK and yet not so many nor so fair as when UNK was broken and the elves UNK that evil was ended for ever and it was not so you remember said frodo speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment but i thought he stammered as elrond turned towards him i thought that the fall of gil-galad was a long age ago so it was indeed answered elrond gravely but my memory reaches back even to the elder days edrendil was my UNK who was born in gondolin before its fall and my UNK was UNK daughter of UNK son of lthien of UNK i have seen three ages in the west of the world and many UNK and many UNK UNK i was the UNK of gil-galad and marched with his host i was at the battle of UNK before the black gate of mordor where we had the UNK for the spear of gil-galad and the sword of elendil UNK and UNK none could withstand i beheld the last UNK on the slopes of UNK where gil-galad died and elendil fell and UNK broke beneath him but sauron himself was UNK and isildur cut the ring from his hand with the UNK of his fathers sword and took it for his own at this the stranger boromir broke in so that is what became of the ring he cried if ever such a tale was told in the south it has long been forgotten i have heard of the great ring of him that we do not name but we believed that it perished from the world in the ruin of his first realm isildur took it that is tidings indeed alas yes said elrond isildur took it as should not have been it should have been cast then into UNK fire nigh at hand where it was made but few marked what isildur did he alone stood by his father in that last mortal UNK and by gil-galad only UNK stood and i but isildur would not listen to our counsel  this i will have as UNK for my father and my brother he said and therefore whether we would or no he took it to treasure it but soon he was betrayed by it to his death and so it is named in the north isildurs bane yet death maybe was better than what else might have befallen him only to the north did these tidings come and only to a few small wonder it is that you have not heard them boromir from the ruin of the gladden fields where isildur perished three men only came ever back over the mountains after long wandering one of these was UNK the UNK of isildur who bore the UNK of the sword of elendil and he brought them to valandil the heir of isildur who being but a child had remained here in rivendell but UNK was broken and its light UNK and it has not yet been forged again UNK did i call the victory of the fast UNK not wholly so yet it did not UNK its end sauron was UNK but not destroyed his ring was lost but not UNK the dark tower was broken but its UNK were not removed for they were made with the power of the ring and while it remains they will endure many elves and many mighty men and many of their friends had perished in the war anbrion was slain and isildur was slain and gil-galad and elendil were no more never again shall there be any such league of elves and men for men UNK and the UNK UNK and the two UNK are UNK and ever since that day the race of nmenor has UNK and the UNK of their years has UNK in the north after the war and the UNK of the gladden fields the men of westernesse were UNK and their city of UNK beside UNK UNK fell into ruin and the heirs of valandil removed and dwelt at UNK on the high north downs and that now too is desolate men call it UNK dike and they fear to tread there for the folk of arnor dwindled and their foes UNK them and their UNK passed leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills in the south the realm of gondor long endured and for a while its splendour grew UNK somewhat of the might of nmenor ere it fell high towers that people built and strong places and havens of many ships and the UNK crown of the kings of men was held in awe by folk of many tongues their chief city was osgiliath UNK of the stars through the midst of which the river flowed and minas UNK they built tower of the rising moon eastward upon a shoulder of the mountains of shadow and westward at the feet of the white mountains minas anor they made tower of the setting sun there in the UNK of the king grew a white tree from the UNK of that tree which isildur brought over the deep waters and the UNK of that tree before came from UNK and before that out of the UNK west in the day before days when the world was young but in the wearing of the swift years of middle-earth the line of UNK son of anbrion failed and the tree withered and the blood of the UNK became mingled with that of lesser men then the watch upon the walls of mordor slept and dark things crept back to UNK and on a time evil things came forth and they took minas UNK and UNK in it and they made it into a place of dread and it is called minas morgul the tower of UNK then minas anor was named UNK minas tirith the tower of guard and these two UNK were ever at war but osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows walked so it has been for many lives of men but the lords of minas tirith still fight on UNK our enemies keeping the passage of the river from argonath to the sea and now that part of the tale that i shall tell is drawn to its close for in the days of isildur the ruling ring passed out of all knowledge and the three were released from its dominion but now in this latter day they are in peril once more for to our sorrow the one has been found others shall speak of its finding for in that i played small part he ceased but at once boromir stood up tall and proud before them give me leave master elrond said he first to say more of gondor for UNK from the land of gondor i am come and it would be well for all to know what passes there for few i deem know of our deeds and therefore guess little of their peril if we should fail at last believe not that in the land of gondor the blood of nmenor is spent nor all its UNK and UNK forgotten by our valour the wild folk of the east are still UNK and the terror of morgul kept at bay and thus alone are peace and UNK maintained in the lands behind us UNK of the west but if the passages of the river should be won what then yet that hour maybe is not now far away the nameless enemy has arisen again smoke rises once more from UNK that we call mount doom the power of the black land grows and we are hard UNK when the enemy returned our folk were driven from UNK our fair domain east of the river though we kept a UNK there and strength of arms but this very year in the days of june sudden war came upon us out of mordor and we were swept away we were UNK for mordor has UNK itself with the UNK and the cruel UNK but it was not by numbers that we were defeated a power was there that we have not felt before some said that it could be seen like a great black horseman a dark shadow under the moon wherever he came a madness filled our foes but fear fell on our UNK so that horse and man gave way and fled only a remnant of our eastern force came back UNK the last bridge that still stood amid the ruins of osgiliath i was in the company that held the bridge until it was cast down behind us four only were saved by swimming my brother and myself and two others but still we fight on holding all the west shores of anduin and those who shelter behind us give us praise if ever they hear our name much praise but little help only from rohan now will any men ride to us when we call in this evil hour i have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues to elrond a hundred and ten days i have journeyed all alone but i do not seek allies in war the might of elrond is in wisdom not in weapons it is said i come to ask for counsel and the UNK of hard words for on the UNK of the sudden UNK a dream came to my brother in a troubled sleep and afterwards a like dream came oft to him again and once to me in that dream i thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a growing thunder but in the west a pale light lingered and out of it i heard a voice remote but clear crying seek for the sword that was broken in imladris it dwells there shall be counsels taken stronger than UNK there shall be shown a token that doom is near at hand for isildurs bane shall UNK and the halfling forth shall stand of these words we could understand little and we spoke to our father denethor lord of minas tirith wise in the lore of gondor this only would he say that imladris was of old the name among the elves of a far northern dale where elrond the UNK dwelt greatest of UNK therefore my brother seeing how desperate was our need was eager to heed the dream and seek for imladris but since the way was full of doubt and danger i took the journey upon myself UNK was my father to give me leave and long have i wandered by roads forgotten seeking the house of elrond of which many had heard but few knew where it lay and here in the house of elrond more shall be made clear to you said aragorn standing up he cast his sword upon the table that stood before elrond and the blade was in two pieces here is the sword that was broken he said and who are you and what have you to do with minas tirith asked boromir looking in wonder at the lean face of the ranger and his UNK cloak he is aragorn son of arathorn said elrond and he is descended through many fathers from isildur UNK son of minas UNK he is the chief of the dnedain in the north and few are now left of that folk then it belongs to you and not to me at all cried frodo in amazement springing to his feet as if he expected the ring to be demanded at once it does not belong to either of us said aragorn but it has been UNK that you should hold it for a while bring out the ring frodo said gandalf solemnly the time has come hold it up and then boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle there was a hush and all turned their eyes on frodo he was shaken by a sudden UNK and fear and he felt a great UNK to reveal the ring and a UNK of its touch he wished he was far away the ring gleamed and flickered as he held it up before them in his trembling hand behold isildurs bane said elrond boromirs eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing the halfling he muttered is then the doom of minas tirith come at last but why then should we seek a broken sword the words were not the doom of minas tirith  said aragorn but doom and great deeds are indeed at hand for the sword that was broken is the sword of elendil that broke beneath him when he fell it has been UNK by his heirs when all other UNK were lost for it was spoken of old among us that it should be made again when the ring isildurs bane was found now you have seen the sword that you have sought what would you ask do you wish for the house of elendil to return to the land of gondor i was not sent to beg any UNK but to seek only the meaning of a riddle answered boromir proudly yet we are hard pressed and the sword of elendil would be a help beyond our UNK such a thing could indeed return out of the shadows of the past he looked again at aragorn and doubt was in his eyes frodo felt bilbo stir impatiently at his side evidently he was annoyed on his friends UNK standing suddenly up he burst out all that is gold does not UNK not all those who wander are lost the old that is strong does not UNK deep roots are not reached by the frost from the ashes a fire shall be UNK a light from the shadows shall spring UNK shall be blade that was broken the UNK again shall be king not very good perhaps but to the point  if you need more beyond the word of elrond if that was worth a journey of a hundred and ten days to hear you had best listen to it he sat down with a UNK i made that up myself he whispered to frodo for the dnadan a long time ago when he first told me about himself i almost wish that my adventures were not over and that i could go with him when his day comes aragorn smiled at him then he turned to boromir again for my part i forgive your doubt he said little do i UNK the figures of elendil and isildur as they stand carven in their UNK in the halls of denethor i am but the heir of isildur not isildur himself i have had a hard life and a long and the leagues that lie between here and gondor are a small part in the count of my journeys i have crossed many mountains and many rivers and trodden many plains even into the far UNK of UNK and UNK where the stars are strange but my home such as i have is in the north for here the heirs of valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father UNK son for many generations our days have darkened and we have dwindled but ever the sword has passed to a new keeper and this i will say to you boromir ere i end lonely men are we rangers of the wild hunters but hunters ever of the servants of the enemy for they are found in many places not in mordor only if gondor boromir has been a UNK tower we have played another part many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do not stay you know little of the lands beyond your bounds peace and UNK do you say the north would have known them little but for us fear would have destroyed them but when dark things come from the UNK hills or creep from UNK woods they fly from us what roads would any dare to tread what safety would there be in quiet lands or in the UNK of simple men at night if the dnedain were asleep or were all gone into the grave and yet less UNK have we than you travellers UNK at us and UNK give us UNK names strider i am to one fat man who lives within a days march of foes that would UNK his heart or lay his little UNK in ruin if he were not guarded UNK yet we would not have it otherwise if simple folk are free from care and fear simple they will be and we must be secret to keep them so that has been the task of my kindred while the years have lengthened and the grass has grown but now the world is changing once again a new hour comes isildurs bane is found battle is at hand the sword shall be UNK i will come to minas tirith isildurs bane is found you say said boromir i have seen a bright ring in the halflings hand but isildur perished ere this age of the world began they say how do the wise know that this ring is his and how has it passed down the years until it is brought hither by so strange a messenger that shall be told said elrond but not yet i beg master said bilbo already the sun is climbing to noon and i feel the need of something to UNK me i had not named you said elrond smiling but i do so now come tell us your tale and if you have not yet cast your story into UNK you may tell it in plain words the UNK the sooner shall you be refreshed very well said bilbo i will do as you bid but i will now tell the true story and if some here have heard me tell it otherwise  he looked UNK at gluin  UNK ask them to forget it and forgive me i only wished to claim the treasure as my very own in those days and to be rid of the name of thief that was put on me but perhaps i understand things a little better now anyway this is what happened to some there bilbos tale was wholly new and they listened with amazement while the old hobbit actually not at all UNK recounted his adventure with gollum at full length he did not UNK a single riddle he would have given also an account of his party and disappearance from the shire if he had been allowed but elrond raised his hand well told my friend he said but that is enough at this time for the moment it UNK to know that the ring passed to frodo your heir let him now speak then less willingly than bilbo frodo told of all his dealings with the ring from the day that it passed into his keeping every step of his journey from hobbiton to the ford of bruinen was questioned and considered and everything that he could recall concerning the black riders was UNK at last he sat down again not bad bilbo said to him you would have made a good story of it if they hadnt kept on interrupting i tried to make a few notes but we shall have to go over it all again together some time if i am to write it up there are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here yes it made quite a long tale answered frodo but the story still does not seem complete to me i still want to know a good deal especially about gandalf galdor of the havens who sat near by UNK him you speak for me also he cried and turning to elrond he said the wise may have good reason to believe that the halflings UNK is indeed the great ring of long debate unlikely though that may seem to those who know less but may we not hear the UNK and i would ask this also what of saruman he is learned in the lore of the rings yet he is not among us what is his UNK he knows the things that we have heard the questions that you ask galdor are bound together said elrond i had not UNK them and they shall be answered but these things it is the part of gandalf to make clear and i call upon him last for it is the place of honour and in all this matter he has been the chief some galdor said gandalf would think the tidings of gluin and the pursuit of frodo UNK enough that the halflings UNK is a thing of great worth to the enemy yet it is a ring what then the nine the UNK keep the seven are taken or destroyed at this gluin stirred but did not speak the three we know of what then is this one that he desires so much there is indeed a wide waste of time between the river and the mountain between the loss and the finding but the gap in the knowledge of the wise has been filled at last yet too slowly for the enemy has been close behind closer even than i feared and well is it that not until this year this very summer as it seems did he learn the full truth some here will remember that many years ago i myself dared to pass the doors of the UNK in dol guldur and secretly explored his ways and found thus that our fears were true he was none other than sauron our enemy of old at length taking shape and power again some too will remember also that saruman UNK us from open deeds against him and for long we watched him only yet at last as his shadow grew saruman UNK and the council put forth its strength and drove the evil out of mirkwood and that was in the very year of the finding of this ring a strange chance if chance it was but we were too late as elrond UNK sauron also had watched us and had long prepared against our stroke UNK mordor from afar through minas morgul where his nine servants dwelt until all was ready then he gave way before us but only UNK to UNK and soon after came to the dark tower and openly declared himself then for the last time the council met for now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the one we feared then that he had some news of it that we knew nothing of but saruman said nay and repeated what he had said to us before that the one would never again be found in middle-earth at the worst said he our enemy knows that we have it not and that it still is lost but what was lost may yet be found he UNK fear not his hope will cheat him have i not UNK studied this matter into anduin the great it fell and long ago while sauron slept it was rolled down the river to the sea there let it lie until the end gandalf fell silent gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of the misty mountains at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long lain hidden he sighed there i was at fault he said i was UNK by the words of saruman the wise but i should have sought for the truth sooner and our peril would now be less we were all at fault said elrond and but for your UNK the darkness maybe would already be upon us but say on from the first my heart UNK me against all reason that i knew said gandalf and i desired to know how this thing came to gollum and how long he had possessed it so i set a watch for him guessing that he would ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure he came but he escaped and was not found and then alas  i let the matter rest watching and waiting only as we have too often done time passed with many UNK until my doubts were awakened again to sudden fear whence came the hobbits ring what if my fear was true should be done with it those things i must decide but i spoke yet of my dread to none knowing the peril of an UNK whisper if it went astray in all the long wars with the dark tower UNK has ever been our greatest UNK that was UNK years ago soon i became aware that spies of many sorts even beasts and birds were gathered round the shire and my fear grew i called for the help of the dnedain and their watch was UNK and i opened my heart to aragorn the heir of isildur and i said aragorn UNK that we should hunt for gollum too late though it may seem and since it seemed fit that isildurs heir should UNK to UNK isildurs fault i went with gandalf on the long and UNK search then gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of wilderland down even to the mountains of shadow and the fences of mordor there we had rumour of him and we guess that he dwelt there long in the dark hills but we never found him and at last i despaired and then in my despair i thought again of a test that might make the finding of gollum UNK the ring itself might tell if it were the one the memory of words at the council came back to me words of saruman UNK at the time i heard them now clearly in my heart  the nine the seven and the three he said had each their proper UNK not so the one it was round and UNK as it were one of the lesser rings but its maker set marks upon it that the UNK maybe could still see and read what those marks were he had not said who now would know the maker and saruman but great though his lore may be it must have a source what hand save saurons ever held this thing ere it was lost the hand of isildur alone with that thought i UNK the UNK and passed swiftly to gondor in former days the members of my order had been well received there but saruman most of all often he had been for long the guest of the lords of the city less welcome did the lord denethor show me then than of old and UNK he permitted me to search among his UNK UNK and books  if indeed you look only as you say for records of ancient days and the beginnings of the city read on  he said for to me what was is less dark than what is to come and that is my care but unless you have more skill even than saruman who has studied here long you will find naught that is not well known to me who am master of the lore of this city so said denethor and yet there lie in his UNK many records that few now can read even of the UNK for their UNK and tongues have become dark to later men and boromir there lies in minas tirith still UNK i guess by any save saruman and myself since the kings failed a UNK that isildur made himself for isildur did not march away straight from the war in mordor as some have told the tale some in the north maybe boromir broke in all know in gondor that he went first to minas anor and dwelt a while with his nephew UNK UNK him before he UNK to him the rule of the south kingdom in that time he planted there the last UNK of the white tree in memory of his brother but in that time also he made this UNK said gandalf and that is not remembered in gondor it would seem for this UNK concerns the ring and thus wrote isildur UNK the great ring shall go now to be an UNK of the north kingdom but records of it shall be left in gondor where also dwell the heirs of elendil lest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow dim and after these words isildur UNK the ring such as he found it it was hot when i first took it hot as a UNK and my hand was UNK so that i doubt if ever again i shall be free of the pain of it yet even as i write it is UNK and it UNK to UNK though it UNK neither its beauty nor its shape already the writing upon it which at first was as clear as red flame UNK and is now only UNK to be read it is UNK in an UNK of eregion for they have no letters in mordor for such UNK work but the language is unknown to me i deem it to be a tongue of the black land since it is foul and UNK what evil it UNK i do not know but i trace here a copy of it lest it fade beyond recall the ring UNK maybe the heat of saurons hand which was black and yet burned like fire and so gil-galad was destroyed and maybe were the gold made hot again the writing would be refreshed UNK for my part i will risk no hurt to this thing of all the works of sauron the only fair it is precious to me though i UNK it with great pain when i read these words my quest was ended for the UNK writing was indeed as isildur guessed in the tongue of mordor and the servants of the tower and what was said UNK was already known for in the day that sauron first put on the one UNK maker of the three was aware of him and from afar he heard him speak these words and so his evil purposes were revealed at once i took my leave of denethor but even as i went northwards messages came to me out of lurien that aragorn had passed that way and that he had found the creature called gollum therefore i went first to meet him and hear his tale into what deadly perils he had gone alone i dared not guess there is little need to tell of them said aragorn if a man must needs walk in sight of the black gate or tread the deadly flowers of morgul vale then perils he will have i too despaired at last and i began my UNK journey and then by fortune i came suddenly on what i sought the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool but now the trail was fresh and swift and it led not to mordor but away along the skirts of the dead marshes i followed it and then i had him UNK by a UNK mere peering in the water as the dark UNK fell i caught him gollum he was covered with green UNK he will never love me i fear for he bit me and i was not gentle nothing more did i ever get from his mouth than the marks of his teeth i UNK it the worst part of all my journey the road back watching him day and night making him walk before me with a UNK on his neck UNK until he was UNK by lack of drink and food driving him ever towards mirkwood i brought him there at last and gave him to the elves for we had agreed that this should be done and i was glad to be rid of his company for he UNK for my part i hope never to look upon him again but gandalf came and endured long speech with him yes long and weary said gandalf but not without UNK for one thing the tale he told of his loss agreed with that which bilbo has now told openly for the first time but that UNK little since i had already guessed it but i learned then first that gollums ring came out of the great river nigh to the gladden fields and i learned also that he had possessed it long many lives of his small kind the power of the ring had lengthened his years far beyond their UNK but that power only the great rings wield and if that is not UNK enough galdor there is the other test that i spoke of upon this very ring which you have here seen held aloft round and UNK the letters that isildur reported may still be read if one has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while that i have done and this i have read ash UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK ash UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK  the change in the wizards voice was UNK suddenly it became menacing powerful harsh as stone a shadow seemed to pass over the high sun and the porch for a moment grew dark all UNK and the elves stopped their ears never before has any voice dared to UNK the words of that tongue in imladris gandalf the grey said elrond as the shadow passed and the company breathed once more and let us hope that none will ever speak it here again answered gandalf nonetheless i do not ask your pardon master elrond for if that tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the west then let all put doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the wise have declared the treasure of the enemy UNK with all his malice and in it lies a great part of his strength of old out of the black years come the words that the smiths of eregion heard and knew that they had been betrayed one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them know also my friends that i learned more yet from gollum he was UNK to speak and his tale was UNK but it is beyond all doubt that he went to mordor and there all that he knew was forced from him thus the enemy knows now that the one is found that it was long in the shire and since his servants have pursued it almost to our door he soon will know already he may know even as i speak that we have it here all sat silent for a while until at length boromir spoke he is a small thing you say this gollum small but great in mischief what became of him to what doom did you put him he is in UNK but no worse said aragorn he had UNK much there is no doubt that he was UNK and the fear of sauron lies black on his heart still i for one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful elves of mirkwood his malice is great and UNK him a strength hardly to be believed in one so lean and withered he could work much mischief still if he were free and i do not doubt that he was allowed to leave mordor on some evil errand alas alas cried legolas and in his fair elvish face there was great UNK the tidings that i was sent to bring must now be told they are not good but only here have i learned how evil they may seem to this company smjagol who is now called gollum has escaped escaped cried aragorn that is ill news indeed we shall all UNK it UNK i fear how came the folk of UNK to fail in their trust not through lack of UNK said legolas but perhaps through over UNK and we fear that the UNK had aid from others and that more is known of our doings than we could wish we guarded this creature day and night at gandalf s bidding much though we UNK of the task but gandalf bade us hope still for his cure and we had not the heart to keep him ever in dungeons under the earth where he would fall back into his old black thoughts you were less UNK to me said gluin with a flash of his eyes as old memories were stirred of his UNK in the deep places of the UNK halls now come said gandalf pray do not UNK my good gluin that was a UNK UNK long set right if all the UNK that stand between elves and dwarves are to be brought up here we may as well UNK this council gluin rose and bowed and legolas continued in the days of fair weather we led gollum through the woods and there was a high tree standing alone far from the others which he liked to climb often we let him mount up to the UNK branches until he felt the free wind but we set a guard at the trees foot one day he refused to come down and the guards had no mind to climb after him he had learned the trick of UNK to boughs with his feet as well as with his hands so they sat by the tree far into the night it was that very night of summer yet UNK and UNK that ores came on us at UNK we drove them off after some time they were many and fierce but they came from over the mountains and were UNK to the woods when the battle was over we found that gollum was gone and his guards were slain or taken it then seemed plain to us that the attack had been made for his UNK and that he knew of it UNK how that was UNK we cannot guess but gollum is cunning and the spies of the enemy are many the dark things that were driven out in the year of the dragons fall have returned in greater numbers and mirkwood is again an evil place save where our realm is maintained we have failed to UNK gollum we came on his trail among those of many ores and it plunged deep into the forest going south but ere long it escaped our skill and we dared not UNK the hunt for we were drawing nigh to dol guldur and that is still a very evil place we do not go that way well well he is gone said gandalf we have no time to seek for him again he must do what he will but he may play a part yet that neither he nor sauron have foreseen and now i will answer UNK other questions what of saruman what are his counsels to us in this need this tale i must tell in full for only elrond has heard it yet and that in brief but it will bear on all that we must UNK it is the last chapter in the tale of the ring so far as it has yet gone at the end of june i was in the shire but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind and i rode to the southern borders of the little land for i had a UNK of some danger still hidden from me but drawing near there messages reached me telling me of war and defeat in gondor and when i heard of the black shadow a chill smote my heart but i found nothing save a few UNK from the south yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of which they would not speak i turned then east and north and journeyed along the greenway and not far from bree i came upon a traveller sitting on a bank beside the road with his UNK horse beside him it was radagast the brown who at one time dwelt at UNK near the borders of mirkwood he is one of my order but i had not seen him for many a year  gandalf   he cried i was seeking you but i am a stranger in these parts all i knew was that you might be found in a wild region with the UNK name of shire  your information was UNK i said but do not put it that way if you meet any of the inhabitants you are near the borders of the shire now and what do you want with me it must be UNK you were never a traveller unless driven by great need  i have an UNK errand he said my news is evil then he looked about him as if the hedges might have ears UNK he whispered the nine are abroad again they have crossed the river secretly and are moving westward they have taken the UNK of riders in black i knew then what i had dreaded without knowing it  the enemy must have some great need or purpose said radagast but what it is that makes him look to these distant and desolate parts i cannot guess v what do you mean  said i v i have been told that wherever they go the riders ask for news of a land called shire  the shire i said but my heart sank for even the wise might fear to withstand the nine when they are gathered together under their fell UNK a great king and UNK he was of old and now he UNK a deadly fear who told you and who sent you  i asked  saruman the white answered radagast and he told me to say that if you feel the need he will help but you must seek his aid at once or it will be too late and that message brought me hope for saruman the white is the greatest of my order radagast is of course a worthy wizard a master of shapes and changes of hue and he has much lore of herbs and beasts and birds are especially his friends but saruman has long studied the UNK of the enemy himself and thus we have often been able to UNK him it was by the UNK of saruman that we drove him from dol guldur it might be that he had found some weapons that would drive back the nine  i will go to saruman i said  then you must go now said radagast for i have UNK time in looking for you and the days are running short i was told to find you before UNK and that is now here even if you set out from this spot you will hardly reach him before the nine discover the land that they seek i myself shall turn back at once and with that he mounted and would have ridden straight off  stay a moment  i said we shall need your help and the help of all things that will give it send out messages to all the beasts and birds that are your friends tell them to bring news of anything that UNK on this matter to saruman and gandalf let messages be sent to orthanc i will do that he said and rode off as if the nine were after him i could not follow him then and there i had ridden very far already that day and i was as weary as my horse and i needed to consider matters i stayed the night in bree and decided that i had no time to return to the shire never did i make a greater mistake however i wrote a message to frodo and trusted to my friend the innkeeper to send it to him i rode away at dawn and i came at long last to the dwelling of saruman that is far south in isengard in the end of the misty mountains not far from the gap of rohan and boromir will tell you that that is a great open vale that lies between the misty mountains and the UNK foothills of UNK UNK the white mountains of his home but isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that UNK a valley as with a wall and in the midst of that valley is a tower of stone called orthanc it was not made by saruman but by the men of nmenor long ago and it is very tall and has many secrets yet it looks not to be a work of craft it cannot be reached save by passing the circle of isengard and in that circle there is only one gate late one evening i came to the gate like a great arch in the wall of rock and it was UNK guarded but the UNK of the gate were on the watch for me and told me that saruman UNK me i rode under the arch and the gate closed silently behind me and suddenly i was afraid though i knew no reason for it but i rode to the foot of orthanc and came to the stair of saruman and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber he wore a ring on his finger so you have come gandalf he said to me gravely but in his eyes there seemed to be a white light as if a cold laughter was in his heart v yes i have come i said i have come for your aid saruman the white and that title seemed to anger him  have you indeed gandalf the grey UNK  he UNK for aid it has seldom been heard of that gandalf the grey sought for aid one so cunning and so wise wandering about the lands and concerning himself in every business whether it belongs to him or not i looked at him and wondered but if i am not UNK said i things are now moving which will UNK the UNK of all our strength  that may be so he said but the thought is late in coming to you how long i wonder have you concealed from me the head of the council a matter of greatest UNK what brings you now from your UNK in the shire   the nine have come forth again i answered they have crossed the river so radagast said to me v radagast the brown  laughed saruman and he no longer concealed his UNK radagast the UNK radagast the simple radagast the fool yet he had just the UNK to play the part that i set him for you have come and that was all the purpose of my message and here you will stay gandalf the grey and rest from journeys for i am saruman the wise saruman UNK saruman of many colours  i looked then and saw that his robes which had seemed white were not so but were woven of all colours and if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so that the eye was UNK  i liked white better i said  white  he UNK it UNK as a beginning white cloth may be UNK the white page can be UNK and the white light can be broken  in which case it is no longer white said i and he that UNK a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom  you need not speak to me as to one of the UNK that you take for friends said he i have not brought you hither to be UNK by you but to give you a choice he drew himself up then and began to UNK as if he were making a speech long UNK the elder days are gone the middle days are passing the younger days are beginning the time of the elves is over but our time is at hand the world of men which we must rule but we must have power power to order all things as we will for that good which only the wise can see  and listen gandalf my old friend and UNK  he said coming near and speaking now in a UNK voice i said we for we it may be if you will join with me a new power is rising against it the old allies and UNK will not avail us at all there is no hope left in elves or dying nmenor this then is one choice before you before us we may join with that power it would be wise gandalf there is hope that way its victory is at hand and there will be rich reward for those that aided it as the power grows its proved friends will also grow and the wise such as you and i may with UNK come at last to direct its courses to UNK it we can UNK our time we can keep our thoughts in our hearts UNK maybe UNK done by the way but UNK the high and UNK purpose knowledge rule order all the things that we have so far UNK in vain to UNK hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends there need not be there would not be any real change in our designs only in our means  saruman i said i have heard UNK of this kind before but only in the mouths of UNK sent from mordor to UNK the UNK i cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears he looked at me UNK and paused a while considering well i see that this wise course does not UNK itself to you he said not yet not if some better way can be UNK  he came and laid his long hand on my arm and why not gandalf  he whispered why not the ruling ring if we could command that then the power would pass to us that is in truth why i brought you here for i have many eyes in my service and i believe that you know where this precious thing now lies is it not so or why do the nine ask for the shire and what is your business there  as he said this a UNK which he could not UNK shone suddenly in his eyes  saruman i said standing away from him only one hand at a time can wield the one and you know that well so do not trouble to say we but i would not give it nay i would not give even news of it to you now that i learn your mind you were head of the council but you have UNK yourself at last well the UNK are it seems to UNK to sauron or to yourself i will take neither have you others to offer  he was cold now and perilous yes he said i did not expect you to show wisdom even in your own UNK but i gave you the chance of UNK me willingly and so UNK yourself much trouble and pain the third choice is to stay here until the end  until what end   until you reveal to me where the one may be found i may find means to UNK you or until it is found in your UNK and the UNK has time to turn to lighter matters to UNK say a UNK reward for the UNK and UNK of gandalf the grey  that may not prove to be one of the lighter matters said i he laughed at me for my words were empty and he knew it they took me and they set me alone on the pinnacle of orthanc in the place where saruman was accustomed to watch the stars there is no UNK save by a narrow stair of many thousand steps and the valley below seems far away i looked on it and saw that UNK it had once been green and fair it was now filled with UNK and UNK wolves and ores were UNK in isengard for saruman was UNK a great force on his own account in UNK of sauron and not in his service yet over all his works a dark smoke hung and wrapped itself about the sides of orthanc i stood alone on an island in the clouds and i had no chance of escape and my days were bitter i was pierced with cold and i had but little room in which to pace to and fro UNK on the coming of the riders to the north that the nine had indeed arisen i felt UNK apart from the words of saruman which might be lies long ere i came to isengard i had heard tidings by the way that could not be UNK fear was ever in my heart for my friends in the shire but still i had some hope i hoped that frodo had set forth at once as my letter had urged and that he had reached rivendell before the deadly pursuit began and both my fear and my hope proved UNK for my hope was founded on a fat man in bree and my fear was founded on the cunning of sauron but fat men who sell ale have many UNK to answer and the power of sauron is still less than fear makes it but in the circle of isengard trapped and alone it was not easy to think that the hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the shire far away i saw you cried frodo you were walking backwards and forwards the moon shone in your hair gandalf paused astonished and looked at him it was only a dream said frodo but it suddenly came back to me i had quite forgotten it it came some time ago after i left the shire i think then it was late in coming said gandalf as you will see i was in an evil plight and those who know me will agree that i have seldom been in such need and do not bear such UNK well gandalf the grey caught like a fly in a UNK treacherous UNK yet even the most UNK UNK may leave a weak UNK at first i feared as saruman no doubt intended that radagast had also fallen yet i had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in his eye at our meeting if i had i should never have gone to isengard or i should have gone more warily so saruman guessed and he had concealed his mind and UNK his messenger it would have been useless in any case to try and UNK over the honest radagast to UNK he sought me in good UNK and so UNK me that was the UNK of UNK plot for radagast knew no reason why he should not do as i asked and he rode away towards mirkwood where he had many friends of old and the eagles of the mountains went far and wide and they saw many things the gathering of wolves and the UNK of ores and the nine riders going hither and thither in the lands and they heard news of the escape of gollum and they sent a messenger to bring these tidings to me so it was that when summer waned there came a night of moon and gwaihir the UNK UNK of the great eagles came UNK to orthanc and he found me standing on the pinnacle then i spoke to him and he bore me away before saruman was aware i was far from isengard ere the wolves and ores issued from the gate to UNK me  how far can you bear me  i said to gwaihir  many leagues said he but not to the ends of the earth i was sent to bear tidings not burdens  then i must have a UNK on land i said and a UNK UNK swift for i have never had such need of haste before  then i will bear you to UNK where the lord of rohan UNK in his halls he said for that is not very far off and i was glad for in the UNK of rohan the UNK the UNK dwell and there are no horses like those that are UNK in that great vale between the misty mountains and the white  are the men of rohan still to be trusted do you think  i said to gwaihir for the UNK of saruman had shaken my UNK  they pay a UNK of horses he answered and send many UNK to mordor or so it is said but they are not yet under the UNK but if saruman has become evil as you say then their doom cannot be long delayed he set me down in the land of rohan ere dawn and now i have lengthened my tale over long the rest must be more brief in rohan i found evil already at work the lies of saruman and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings he bade me take a horse and be gone and i chose one much to my liking but little to his i took the best horse in his land and i have never seen the like of him then he must be a noble beast indeed said aragorn and it UNK me more than many tidings that might seem worse to learn that sauron UNK such UNK it was not so when last i was in that land nor is it now i will UNK said boromir it is a lie that comes from the enemy i know the men of rohan true and valiant our allies dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago the shadow of mordor lies on distant lands answered aragorn saruman has fallen under it rohan is UNK who knows what you will find there if ever you return not this at least said boromir that they will UNK their lives with horses they love their horses next to their kin and not without reason for the horses of the UNK come from the fields of the north far from the shadow and their race as that of their masters is descended from the free days of old true indeed said gandalf and there is one among them that might have been UNK in the morning of the world the horses of the nine cannot UNK with him UNK swift as the flowing wind UNK they called him by day his coat UNK like silver and by night it is like a shade and he passes unseen light is his UNK never before had any man mounted him but i took him and i UNK him and so UNK he bore me that i reached the shire when frodo was on the barrow-downs though i set out from rohan only when he set out from hobbiton but fear grew in me as i rode ever as i came north i heard tidings of the riders and though i UNK on them day by day they were ever before me they had divided their UNK i learned some remained on the eastern borders not far from the greenway and some UNK the shire from the south i came to hobbiton and frodo had gone but i had words with old gamgee many words and few to the point he had much to say about the UNK of the new UNK of bag end  i cant UNK changes said he not at my time of life and least of all changes for the worst changes for the worst he repeated many times  worst is a bad word i said to him and i hope you do not live to see it but UNK his talk i gathered at last that frodo had left hobbiton less than a week before and that a black horseman had come to the hill the same evening then i rode on in fear i came to buckland and found it in UNK as busy as a UNK of UNK that has been stirred with a stick i came to the house at crickhollow and it was broken open and empty but on the threshold there lay a cloak that had been frodos then for a while hope left me and i did not wait to gather news or i might have been UNK but i rode on the trail of the riders it was hard to follow for it went many ways and i was at a loss but it seemed to me that one or two had ridden towards bree and that way i went for i thought of words that might be said to the innkeeper  butterbur they call him thought i if this delay was his fault i will melt all the butter in him i will UNK the old fool over a slow fire he expected no less and when he saw my face he fell down flat and began to melt on the spot what did you do to him cried frodo in alarm he was really very kind to us and did all that he could gandalf laughed dont be afraid he said i did not bite and i UNK very little so UNK was i by the news that i got out of him when he stopped quaking that i UNK the old fellow how it happened i could not then guess but i learned that you had been in bree the night before and had gone off that morning with strider  strider  i cried shouting for joy yes sir i am afraid so sir said butterbur UNK me he got at them in spite of all that i could do and they took up with him they UNK very queer all the time they were here UNK you might say UNK fool UNK worthy and beloved barliman  said i its the best news i have had since UNK its worth a gold piece at the least may your beer be laid under an UNK of UNK UNK for seven years  said i now i can take a nights rest the first since i have forgotten when UNK stayed there that night wondering much what had become of the riders for only of two had there yet been any news in bree it seemed but in the night we heard more five at least came from the west and they threw down the gates and passed through bree like a howling wind and the bree-folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world i got up before dawn and went after them i do not know but it seems clear to me that this is what happened their captain remained in secret away south of bree while two rode ahead through the village and four more UNK the shire but when these were UNK in bree and at crickhollow they returned to their captain with tidings and so left the road UNK for a while except by their spies the captain then sent some eastward straight across country and he himself with the rest rode along the road in great wrath i galloped to weathertop like a UNK and i reached it before UNK on my second day from UNK they were there before me they drew away from me for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it while the sun was in the sky but they closed round at night and i was UNK on the hill -top in the old ring of amon UNK i was hard put to it indeed such light and flame cannot have been seen on weathertop since the UNK of old at sunrise i escaped and fled towards the north i could not hope to do more it was impossible to find you frodo in the wilderness and it would have been folly to try with all the nine at my UNK UNK had to trust to aragorn but i hoped to draw some of them off and yet reach rivendell ahead of you and send out help four riders did indeed follow me but they turned back after a while and made for the ford it seems that helped a little for there were only five not nine when your camp was attacked i reached here at last by a long hard road up the UNK and through the ettenmoors and down from the north it took me nearly UNK days from weathertop for i could not ride among the rocks of the UNK and UNK departed i sent him back to his master but a great friendship has grown between us and if i have need he will come at my call but so it was that i came to rivendell only three days before the ring and news of its peril had already been brought UNK proved well indeed and that frodo is the end of my account may elrond and the others forgive the length of it but such a thing has not happened before that gandalf broke UNK and did not come when he promised an account to the ring-bearer of so strange an event was required i think well the tale is now told from first to last here we all are and here is the ring but we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose what shall we do with it there was silence at last elrond spoke again this is grievous news concerning saruman he said for we trusted him and he is deep in all our counsels it is perilous to study too deeply the UNK of the enemy for good or for ill but such falls and UNK alas have happened before of the tales that we have heard this day the tale of frodo was most strange to me i have known few hobbits save bilbo here and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and UNK as i had thought him the world has changed much since i last was on the westward roads the barrow- wights we know by many names and of the old forest many tales have been told all that now remains is but an UNK of its northern march time was when a UNK could go from tree to tree from what is now the shire to UNK west of isengard in those lands i journeyed once and many things wild and strange i knew but i had forgotten bombadil if indeed this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago and even then was older than the old that was not then his name UNK UNK we called him oldest and UNK but many another name he has since been given by other folk UNK by the dwarves UNK by northern men and other names beside he is a strange creature but maybe i should have summoned him to our council he would not have come said gandalf could we not still send messages to him and UNK his help asked erestor it seems that he has a power even over the ring no i should not put it so said gandalf say rather that the ring has no power over him he is his own master but he cannot UNK the ring itself nor break its power over others and now he is withdrawn into a little land within bounds that he has set though none can see them waiting perhaps for a change of days and he will not step beyond them but within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him said erestor would he not take the ring and keep it there for ever UNK no said gandalf not willingly he might do so if all the free folk of the world begged him but he would not understand the need and if he were given the ring he would soon forget it or most likely throw it away such things have no hold on his mind he would be a most UNK UNK and that alone is answer enough but in any case said glorfindel to send the ring to him would only UNK the day of evil he is far away we could not now take it back to him UNK UNK by any spy and even if we could soon or late the lord of the rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his power towards it could that power be UNK by bombadil alone i think not i think that in the end if all else is UNK bombadil will fall last as he was first and then night will come i know little of UNK save the name said galdor but glorfindel i think is right power to UNK our enemy is not in him unless such power is in the earth itself and yet we see that sauron can UNK and destroy the very hills what power still remains lies with us here in imladris or with UNK at the havens or in lurien but have they the strength have we here the strength to withstand the enemy the coming of sauron at the last when all else is UNK i have not the strength said elrond neither have they then if the ring cannot be kept from him for ever by strength said glorfindel two things only remain for us to attempt to send it over the sea or to destroy it but gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here possess said elrond and they who dwell beyond the sea would not UNK it for good or ill it belongs to middle-earth it is for us who still dwell here to deal with it then said glorfindel let us cast it into the deeps and so make the lies of saruman come true for it is clear now that even at the council his feet were already on a crooked path he knew that the ring was not lost for ever but wished us to think so for he began to UNK for it for himself yet oft in lies truth is hidden in the sea it would be safe not safe for ever said gandalf there are many things in the deep waters and seas and lands may change and it is not our part here to take thought only for a UNK or for a few lives of men or for a passing age of the world we should seek a final end of this UNK even if we do not hope to make one and that we shall not find on the roads to the sea said galdor if the return to UNK be thought too dangerous then flight to the UNK is now UNK with UNK peril my heart tells me that sauron will expect us to take the western way when he UNK what has befallen he soon will the nine have been UNK indeed but that is but a UNK ere they find new steeds and UNK only the waning might of gondor stands now between him and a march in power along the UNK into the north and if he comes UNK the white towers and the havens UNK the elves may have no escape from the UNK shadows of middle-earth long yet will that march be delayed said boromir gondor UNK you say but gondor stands and even the end of its strength is still very strong and yet its UNK can no longer keep back the nine said galdor and other roads he may find that gondor does not guard then said erestor there are but two courses as glorfindel already has declared to hide the ring for ever or to UNK it but both are beyond our power who will read this riddle for us none here can do so said elrond gravely at least none can UNK what will come to pass if we take this road or that but it seems to me now clear which is the road that we must take the westward road seems UNK therefore it must be UNK it will be watched too often the elves have fled that way now at this last we must take a hard road a road UNK there lies our hope if hope it be to walk into UNK mordor we must send the ring to the fire silence fell again frodo even in that fair house looking out upon a sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters felt a dead darkness in his heart boromir stirred and frodo looked at him he was fingering his great horn and UNK at length he spoke i do not understand all this he said saruman is a UNK but did he not have a glimpse of wisdom why do you speak ever of hiding and UNK why should we not think that the great ring has come into our hands to serve us in the very hour of need UNK it the free lords of the free may surely defeat the enemy that is what he most fears i deem the men of gondor are valiant and they will never UNK but they may be beaten down valour needs first strength and then a weapon let the ring be your weapon if it has such power as you say take it and go forth to victory alas no said elrond we cannot use the ruling ring that we now know too well it belongs to sauron and was made by him alone and is altogether evil its strength boromir is too great for anyone to wield at will save only those who have already a great power of their own but for them it holds an even UNK peril the very desire of it UNK the heart consider saruman if any of the wise should with this ring UNK the lord of mordor using his own UNK he would then set himself on saurons throne and yet another dark lord would appear and that is another reason why the ring should be destroyed as long as it is in the world it will be a danger even to the wise for nothing is evil in the beginning even sauron was not so i fear to take the ring to hide it i will not take the ring to wield it nor i said gandalf boromir looked at them doubtfully but he bowed his head so be it he said then in gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have and at the least while the wise ones guard this ring we will fight on UNK the UNK may still stem the UNK  if the hand that UNK it has UNK not an UNK only but the UNK of the kings of men who can tell said aragorn but we will put it to the test one day may the day not be too long delayed said boromir for though i do not ask for aid we need it it would comfort us to know that others fought also with all the means that they have then be UNK said elrond for there are other powers and UNK that you know not and they are hidden from you anduin the great flows past many shores ere it comes to argonath and the gates of gondor still it might be well for all said gluin the dwarf if all these UNK were joined and the powers of each were used in league other rings there may be less treacherous that might be used in our need the seven are lost to us  if balin has not found the ring of thrur which was the last naught has been heard of it since thrur perished in moria indeed i may now reveal that it was partly in hope to find that ring that balin went away balin will find no ring in moria said gandalf thrur gave it to thrbin his son but not thrbin to thorin it was taken with torment from thrbin in the dungeons of dol guldur i came too late ah alas cried gluin when will the day come of our revenge but still there are the three what of the three rings of the elves very mighty rings it is said do not the elf-lords keep them yet they too were made by the dark lord long ago are they idle i see elf-lords here will they not say the elves returned no answer did you not hear me gluin said elrond the three were not made by sauron nor did he ever touch them but of them it is not permitted to speak so much only in this hour of doubt i may now say they are not idle but they were not made as weapons of war or UNK that is not their power those who made them did not desire strength or UNK or UNK wealth but UNK making and healing to UNK all things UNK these things the elves of middle-earth have in some measure UNK though with sorrow but all that has been wrought by those who wield the three will turn to their UNK and their minds and hearts will become revealed to sauron if he UNK the one it would be better if the three had never been that is his purpose but what then would happen if the ruling ring were destroyed as you counsel asked gluin we know not for certain answered elrond sadly some hope that the three rings which sauron has never touched would then become free and their UNK might heal the UNK of the world that he has wrought but maybe when the one has gone the three will fail and many fair things will fade and be forgotten that is my UNK yet all the elves are willing to endure this chance said glorfindel if by it the power of sauron may be broken and the fear of his dominion be taken away for ever thus we return once more to the UNK of the ring said erestor and yet we come no nearer what strength have we for the finding of the fire in which it was made that is the path of despair of folly i would say if the long wisdom of elrond did not UNK me despair or folly said gandalf it is not despair for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt we do not it is wisdom to UNK UNK when all other courses have been weighed though as folly it may appear to those who UNK to false hope well let folly be our cloak a veil before the eyes of the enemy for he is very wise and UNK all things to a UNK in the UNK of his malice but the only measure that he knows is desire desire for power and so he UNK all hearts into his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it that having the ring we may seek to destroy it if we seek this we shall put him out of reckoning at least for a while said elrond the road must be UNK but it will be very hard and neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it this quest may be UNK by the weak with as much hope as the strong yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the UNK of the world small hands do them because they must while the eyes of the great are elsewhere very well very well master elrond said bilbo suddenly say no more it is plain enough what you are pointing at bilbo the silly hobbit started this affair and bilbo had better finish it or himself i was very comfortable here and getting on with my book if you want to know i am just writing an ending for it i had thought of putting and he lived happily ever afterwards to the end of his days it is a good ending and none the worse for having been used before now i shall have to UNK that it does not look like coming true and anyway there will evidently have to be several more chapters if i live to write them it is a UNK nuisance when ought i to start  boromir looked in surprise at bilbo but the laughter died on his lips when he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave UNK only gluin smiled but his smile came from old memories of course my dear bilbo said gandalf if you had really started this affair you might be expected to finish it but you know well enough now that starting is too great a claim for any and that only a small part is played in great deeds by any UNK you need not bow though the word was meant and we do not doubt that under UNK you are making a valiant offer but one beyond your strength bilbo you cannot take this thing back it has passed on if you need my advice any longer i should say that your part is ended unless as a UNK finish your book and leave the ending UNK there is still hope for it but get ready to write a UNK when they come back bilbo laughed i have never known you give me pleasant advice before he said as all your unpleasant advice has been good i wonder if this advice is not bad still i dont suppose i have the strength or luck left to deal with the ring it has grown and i have not but tell me what do you mean by they the messengers who are sent with the ring exactly and who are they to be that seems to me what this council has to decide and all that it has to decide elves may UNK on speech alone and dwarves endure great weariness but i am only an old hobbit and i miss my meal at noon cant you think of some names now or put it off till after dinner no one answered the UNK rang still no one spoke frodo glanced at all the faces but they were not turned to him all the council sat with UNK eyes as if in deep thought a great dread fell on him as if he was UNK the UNK of some doom that he had long foreseen and UNK hoped might after all never be spoken an UNK longing to rest and remain at peace by bilbos side in rivendell filled all his heart at last with an effort he spoke and wondered to hear his own words as if some other will was using his small voice i will take the ring he said though i do not know the way elrond raised his eyes and looked at him and frodo felt his heart pierced by the sudden UNK of the glance if i understand UNK all that i have heard he said i think that this task is UNK for you frodo and that if you do not find a way no one will this is the hour of the shire-folk when they UNK from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of the great who of all the wise could have foreseen it or if they are wise why should they expect to know it until the hour has struck but it is a heavy burden so heavy that none could lay it on another i do not lay it on you but if you take it freely i will say that your choice is right and though all the mighty UNK of old UNK and UNK and UNK and beren himself were UNK together your seat should be among them but you wont send him off alone surely master cried sam unable to UNK himself any longer and UNK up from the corner where he had been quietly sitting on the floor no indeed said elrond turning towards him with a smile you at least shall go with him it is hardly possible to UNK you from him even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not sam sat down UNK and muttering a nice UNK we have UNK ourselves in mr frodo he said shaking his head chapter   the ring goes south later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in bilbos room merry and pippin were UNK when they heard that sam had crept into the council and had been chosen as frodos companion its most UNK said pippin instead of throwing him out and clapping him in chains elrond goes and UNK him for his UNK UNK said frodo i cant imagine a more UNK UNK you are not thinking what you are saying UNK to go on this UNK journey a reward yesterday i UNK that my task was done and i could rest here a long while perhaps for good i dont wonder said merry and i wish you could but we are UNK sam not you if you have to go then it will be a UNK for any of us to be left behind even in rivendell we have come a long way with you and been through some stiff times we want to go on thats what i meant said pippin we hobbits ought to stick together and we will i shall go unless they chain me up there must be someone with UNK in the party then you certainly will not be chosen peregrin took said gandalf looking in through the window which was near the ground but you are all worrying yourselves UNK nothing is decided yet nothing decided cried pippin then what were you all doing you were shut up for hours talking said bilbo there was a deal of talk and everyone had an UNK even old gandalf i think UNK bit of news about gollum caught even him on the hop though he passed it off you were wrong said gandalf you were UNK i had already heard of it from gwaihir if you want to know the only real UNK as you put it were you and frodo and i was the only one that was not surprised well anyway said bilbo nothing was decided beyond choosing poor frodo and sam i was afraid all the time that it might come to that if i was let off but if you ask me elrond will send out a fair number when the reports come in have they started yet gandalf yes said the wizard some of the UNK have been sent out already more will go tomorrow elrond is UNK elves and they will get in touch with the rangers and maybe with UNK folk in mirkwood and aragorn has gone with elronds sons we shall have to UNK the lands all round for many long leagues before any move is made so UNK up frodo you will probably make quite along stay here ah said sam UNK well just wait long enough for winter to come that cant be helped said bilbo its your fault partly frodo my lad UNK on waiting for my birthday a funny way of UNK it i cant help thinking not the day i should have chosen for letting the s-bs into bag end but there it is you cant wait now fill spring and you cant go till the reports come back when winter first begins to bite and stones crack in the UNK night when pools are black and trees are bare UNK evil in the wild to fare but that i am afraid will be just your luck i am afraid it will said gandalf we cant start until we have found out about the riders t thought they were all destroyed in the flood said merry you cannot destroy ringwraiths like that said gandalf the power of their master is in them and they stand or fall by him we hope that they were all UNK and UNK and so made for a while less dangerous but we must find out for certain in the meantime you should try and forget your troubles frodo i do not know if i can do anything to help you but i will whisper this in your ears someone said that UNK would be needed in the party he was right i think i shall come with you so great was frodos delight at this UNK that gandalf left the UNK where he had been sitting and took off his hat and bowed i only said i think i shall come do not count on anything yet in this matter elrond will have much to say and your friend the strider which UNK me i want to see elrond i must be off how long do you think i shall have here said frodo to bilbo when gandalf had gone oh i dont know i cant count days in rivendell said bilbo but quite long i should think we can have many a good talk what about UNK me with my book and making a start on the next have you thought of an ending yes several and all are dark and unpleasant said frodo oh that wont do said bilbo books ought to have good UNK how would this do and they all settled down and lived together happily ever after it will do well if it ever comes to that said frodo ah said sam and where will they live thats what i often wonder for a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey and of the perils that lay ahead but such was the virtue of the land of rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds the future good or ill was not forgotten but ceased to have any power over the present health and hope grew strong in them and they were content with each good day as it came taking UNK in every meal and in every word and song so the days slipped away as each morning dawned bright and fair and each evening followed cool and clear but autumn was waning fast slowly the golden light faded to pale silver and the UNK leaves fell from the naked trees a wind began to blow chill from the misty mountains to the east the hunters moon UNK round in the night sky and put to flight all the lesser stars but low in the south one star shone red every night as the moon waned again it shone brighter and brighter frodo could see it from his window deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that UNK above the trees on the brink of the valley the hobbits had been nearly two months in the house of elrond and UNK had gone by with the last UNK of autumn and UNK was passing when the UNK began to return some had gone north beyond the springs of the hoarwell into the ettenmoors and others had gone west and with the help of aragorn and the rangers had searched the lands far down the greyflood as far as UNK where the old north road crossed the river by a ruined UNK many had gone east and south and some of these had crossed the mountains and entered mirkwood while others had climbed the pass at the source of the gladden river and had come down into wilderland and over the gladden fields and so at length had reached the old home of radagast at UNK radagast was not there and they had returned over the high pass that was called the dimrill stair the sons of elrond UNK and UNK were the last to return they had made a great journey passing down the silverlode into a strange country but of their errand they would not speak to any save to elrond in no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the riders or other servants of the enemy even from the eagles of the misty mountains they had learned no fresh news nothing had been seen or heard of gollum but the wild wolves were still gathering and were hunting again far up the great river three of the black horses had been found at once drowned in the UNK ford on the rocks of the rapids below it UNK discovered the bodies of five more and also a long black cloak UNK and UNK of the black riders no other trace was to be seen and nowhere was their presence to be felt it seemed that they had vanished from the north eight out of the nine are accounted for at least said gandalf it is UNK to be too sure yet i think that we may hope now that the ringwraiths were scattered and have been obliged to return as best they could to their master in mordor empty and shapeless UNK that is so it will be some time before they can begin the hunt again of course the enemy has other servants but they will have to journey all the way to the borders of rivendell before they can pick up our trail and if we are careful that will be hard to find but we must delay no longer elrond summoned the hobbits to him he looked gravely at frodo the time has come he said if the ring is to set out it must go soon but those who go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or force they must pass into the domain of the enemy far from aid do you still hold to your word frodo that you will be the ring-bearer i do said frodo i will go with sam then i cannot help you much not even with counsel said elrond i can UNK very little of your road and how your task is to be UNK i do not know the shadow has crept now to the feet of the mountains and draws nigh even to the borders of greyflood and under the shadow all is dark to me you will meet many foes some open and some UNK and you may find friends upon your way when you least look for it i will send out messages such as i can UNK to those whom i know in the wide world but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well UNK or come no quicker than you yourself and i will choose you companions to go with you as far as they will or fortune UNK the number must be few since your hope is in speed and UNK had i a host of elves in UNK of the elder days it would avail little save to UNK the power of mordor the company of the ring shall be nine and the nine UNK shall be set against the nine riders that are evil with you and your faithful servant gandalf will go for this shall be his great task and maybe the end of his labours for the rest they shall UNK the other free UNK of the world elves dwarves and men legolas shall be for the elves and gimli son of gluin for the dwarves they are willing to go at least to the passes of the mountains and maybe beyond for men you shall have aragorn son of arathorn for the ring of isildur concerns him closely strider said frodo yes he said with a smile i ask leave once again to be your companion frodo i would have begged you to come said frodo only i thought you were going to minas tirith with boromir i am said aragorn and the UNK shall be UNK ere i set out to war but your road and our road lie together for many hundreds of miles therefore boromir will also be in the company he is a valiant man there remain two more to be found said elrond these i will consider of my household i may find some that it seems good to me to send but that will leave no place for us cried pippin in dismay we dont want to be left behind we want to go with frodo that is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies ahead said elrond neither does frodo said gandalf unexpectedly UNK pippin nor do any of us see clearly it is true that if these hobbits understood the danger they would not dare to go but they would still wish to go or wish that they dared and be UNK and UNK i think elrond that in this matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to great wisdom even if you chose for us an elf-lord such as glorfindel he could not storm the dark tower nor open the road to the fire by the power that is in him you speak gravely said elrond but i am in doubt the shire i UNK is not free now from peril and these two i had thought to send back there as messengers to do what they could according to the fashion of their country to warn the people of their danger in any case i judge that the younger of these two peregrin took should remain my heart is against his going then master elrond you will have to lock me in UNK or send me home UNK in a UNK said pippin for otherwise i shall follow the company let it be so then you shall go said elrond and he sighed now the tale of nine is filled in seven days the company must depart the sword of elendil was forged UNK by elvish smiths and on its blade was UNK a UNK of seven stars set between the UNK moon and the UNK sun and about them was written many runes for aragorn son of arathorn was going to war upon the marches of mordor very bright was that sword when it was made whole again the light of the sun shone UNK in it and the light of the moon shone cold and its edge was hard and keen and aragorn gave it a new name and called it andril flame of the west aragorn and gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the perils they would meet and they pondered the UNK and UNK maps and books of lore that were in the house of elrond sometimes frodo was with them but he was content to lean on their UNK and he spent as much time as he could with bilbo in those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the hall of fire and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of beren and lthien and the UNK of the great jewel but in the day while merry and pippin were out and about frodo and sam were to be found with bilbo in his own small room then bilbo would read passages from his book which still seemed very UNK or UNK of his verses or would take notes of frodos adventures on the morning of the last day frodo was alone with bilbo and the old hobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden box he lifted the lid and UNK inside here is your sword he said but it was broken you know i took it to keep it safe but ive forgotten to ask if the smiths could UNK it no time now so i thought perhaps you would care to have this dont you know he took from the box a small sword in an old UNK UNK UNK then he drew it and its polished and UNK blade glittered suddenly cold and bright this is sting he said and thrust it with little effort deep into a wooden UNK take it if you like i shant want it again i expect frodo accepted it UNK also there is this said bilbo bringing out a UNK which seemed to be rather heavy for its size he UNK several UNK of old cloth and held up a small UNK of mail it was UNK of many rings as UNK almost as UNK cold as UNK and harder than steel it shone like UNK silver and was studded with white gems with it was a belt of pearl and crystal its a pretty thing isnt it said bilbo moving it in the light and useful it is my UNK that thorin gave me i got it back from michel delving before i started and packed it with my luggage i brought all the UNK of my journey away with me except the ring but i did not expect to use this and i dont need it now except to look at sometimes you hardly feel any weight when you put it on i should look  well i dont think i should look right in it said frodo just what i said myself said bilbo but never mind about looks you can wear it under your outer clothes come on you must share this secret with me dont tell UNK else but i should feel happier if i knew you were wearing it i have a fancy it would turn even the knives of the black riders he ended in a low voice very well i will take it said frodo bilbo put it on him and fastened sting upon the glittering belt and then frodo put over the top his old UNK UNK UNK and jacket just a plain hobbit you look said bilbo but there is more about you now than UNK on the surface good luck to you he turned away and looked out of the window trying to UNK a tune i cannot thank you as i should bilbo for this and for all our past UNK said frodo dont try said the old hobbit turning round and UNK him on the back UNK he cried you are too hard now to UNK but there you are hobbits must stick together and especially bagginses all i ask in return is take as much care of yourself as you can and bring back all the news you can and any old songs and tales you can come by ill do my best to finish my book before you return i should like to write the second book if i am UNK he broke off and turned to the window again singing softly i sit beside the fire and think of all that i have seen of UNK and UNK in summers that have been of yellow leaves and UNK in UNK that there were with morning mist and silver sun and wind upon my hair i sit beside the fire and think of how the world will be when winter comes without a spring that i shall ever see for still there are so many things that i have never seen in every wood in every spring there is a different green i sit beside the fire and think of people long ago and people who will see a world that i shall never know but all the while i sit and think of times there were before i listen for returning feet and voices at the door it was a cold grey day near the end of UNK the east wind was streaming through the bare branches of the trees and UNK in the dark UNK on the hills UNK clouds were hurrying overhead dark and low as the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to fall the company made ready to set out they were to start at dusk for elrond UNK them to journey under cover of night as often as they could until they were far from ri vendell you should fear the many eyes of the servants of sauron he said i do not doubt that news of the UNK of the riders has already reached him and he will be filled with wrath soon now his spies on foot and UNK will be abroad in the northern lands even of the sky above you must UNK as you go on your way the company took little gear of war for their hope was in UNK not in battle aragorn had andril but no other weapon and he went forth clad only in UNK green and brown as a ranger of the wilderness boromir had a long sword in fashion like andril but of less UNK and he bore also a shield and his war UNK loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the hills he said and then let all the foes of gondor UNK putting it to his lips he blew a UNK and the echoes leapt from rock to rock and all that heard that voice in rivendell sprang to their feet slow should you be to wind that horn again boromir said elrond until you stand once more on the borders of your land and UNK need is on you maybe said boromir but always i have let my horn cry at setting forth and though UNK we may walk in the shadows i will not go forth as a thief in the night gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short UNK of UNK for dwarves make light of burdens and in his belt was a UNK axe legolas had a bow and a quiver and at his belt a long white knife the younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow but frodo took only sting and his UNK as bilbo wished remained hidden gandalf bore his staff but UNK at his side was the UNK glamdring the UNK of UNK that lay now upon the breast of thorin under the lonely mountain all were well UNK by elrond with thick warm clothes and they had UNK and cloaks lined with UNK spare food and clothes and blankets and other needs were laden on a pony none other than the poor beast that they had brought from bree he stay in rivendell had UNK a great wonder of change on him he was UNK and seemed to have the vigour of youth it was sam who had insisted on choosing him UNK that bill as he called him would UNK if he did not come that animal can nearly talk he said and would talk if he stayed here much longer he gave me a look as plain as mr pippin could speak it if you dont let me go with you sam ill follow on my own so bill was going as the beast of burden yet he was the only member of the company that did not seem UNK their UNK had been said in the great hall by the fire and they were only waiting now for gandalf who had not yet come out of the house a gleam of firelight came from the open doors and soft lights were glowing in many windows bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside frodo aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees only elrond knew fully what this hour meant to him the others could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness sam was standing by the pony UNK his teeth and staring UNK into the gloom where the river roared UNK below his desire for adventure was at its UNK UNK bill my lad he said you UNK to have took up with us you could have stayed here and UNK the best UNK till the new grass comes bill UNK his tail and said nothing sam UNK the pack on his shoulders and went over anxiously in his mind all the things that he had stowed in it wondering if he had forgotten anything his chief treasure his UNK gear and the little box of UNK that he always carried and UNK when he could a good UNK of UNK UNK but not near enough ill UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK UNK various small UNK of his masters that frodo had forgotten and sam had stowed to bring them out in UNK when they were called for he went through them all rope he muttered no rope and only last night you said to yourself sam what about a bit of rope youll want it if you havent got it well ill want it i cant get it now at that moment elrond came out with gandalf and he called the company to him this is my last word he said in a low voice the ring-bearer is setting out on the quest of mount doom on him alone is any UNK laid neither to cast away the ring nor to UNK it to any servant of the enemy nor indeed to let any handle it save members of the company and the council and only then in UNK need the others go with him as free companions to help him on his way you may UNK or come back or turn aside into other paths as chance UNK the further you go the less easy will it be to UNK yet no UNK or UNK is laid on you to go further than you will for you do not yet know the strength of your hearts and you cannot UNK what each may meet upon the road UNK is he that says farewell when the road UNK said gimli maybe said elrond but let him not UNK to walk in the dark who has not seen the nightfall yet UNK word may UNK quaking heart said gimli or break it said elrond look not too far ahead but go now with good hearts  farewell and may the UNK of elves and men and all free folk go with you may the stars shine upon your faces good    good luck cried bilbo UNK with the cold i dont suppose you will be able to keep a UNK frodo my lad but i shall expect a full account when you get back and dont be too long farewell many others of elronds household stood in the shadows and watched them go bidding them farewell with soft voices there was no laughter and no song or music at last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk they crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that led out of the cloven vale of rivendell and they came at length to the high UNK where the wind hissed through the heather then with one glance at the last UNK UNK twinkling below them they strode away far into the night at the ford of bruinen they left the road and turning southwards went on by narrow paths among the UNK lands their purpose was to hold this course west of the mountains for many miles and days the country was much UNK and more barren than in the green vale of the great river in wilderland on the other side of the range and their going would be slow but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes the spies of sauron had UNK seldom been seen in this empty country and the paths were little known except to the people of rivendell gandalf walked in front and with him went aragorn who knew this land even in the dark the others were in file behind and legolas whose eyes were keen was the UNK the first part of their journey was hard and dreary and frodo remembered little of it save the wind for many UNK days an icy UNK came from the mountains in the east and no UNK seemed able to keep out its searching fingers though the company was well clad they seldom felt warm either moving or at rest they slept uneasily during the middle of the day in some hollow of the land or hidden under the tangled UNK that grew in thickets in many places in the late afternoon they were roused by the watch and took their chief meal cold and cheerless as a rule for they could seldom risk the UNK of a fire in the evening they went on again always as nearly southward as they could find a way at first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and stumbled until they were weary they were creeping forward like UNK and getting nowhere each day the land looked much the same as it had the day before yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer south of rivendell they rose ever higher and bent westwards and about the feet of the main range there was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills and deep valleys filled with UNK waters paths were few and winding and led them often only to the edge of some sheer fall or down into treacherous UNK they had been a UNK on the way when the weather changed the wind suddenly fell and then UNK round to the south the UNK clouds lifted and melted away and the sun came out pale and bright there came a cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling UNK the travellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly -trees whose UNK trunks seemed to have been built out of the very stone of the hills their dark leaves shone and their UNK glowed red in the light of the rising sun away in the south frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the path that the company was taking at the left of this high range rose three peaks the UNK and nearest stood up like a UNK tipped with snow its great bare northern UNK was still largely in the shadow but where the sunlight UNK upon it it glowed red gandalf stood at frodos side and looked out under his hand we have done well he said we have reached the borders of the country that men call hollin many elves lived here in happier days when eregion was its name UNK leagues as the UNK flies we have come though many long miles further our feet have walked the land and the weather will be UNK now but perhaps all the more dangerous dangerous or not a real sunrise is mighty welcome said frodo throwing back his hood and letting the morning light fall on his face but the mountains are ahead of us said pippin we must have turned eastwards in the night no said gandalf but you see further ahead in the clear light beyond those peaks the range UNK round south-west there are many maps in elronds house but i suppose you never thought to look at them yes i did sometimes said pippin but i dont remember them frodo has a better head for that sort of thing i need no UNK said gimli who had come up with legolas and was gazing out before him with a strange light in his deep eyes there is the land where our fathers UNK of old and we have wrought the UNK of those mountains into many works of metal and of stone and into many songs and tales they stand tall in our dreams UNK UNK UNK only once before have i seen them from afar in waking life but i know them and their names for under them lies khazad-dym the UNK that is now called the black pit moria in the elvish tongue yonder stands UNK the redhorn cruel caradhras and beyond him are UNK and UNK UNK the white and UNK the grey that we call UNK and UNK there the misty mountains UNK and between their arms lies the UNK valley which we cannot forget UNK the dimrill dale which the elves call UNK it is for the dimrill dale that we are making said gandalf if we climb the pass that is called the redhorn gate under the far side of caradhras we shall come down by the dimrill stair into the deep vale of the dwarves there lies the mirrormere and there the river silverlode rises in its icy springs dark is the water of kheled-zvram said gimli and cold are the springs of UNK my heart UNK at the thought that i may see them soon may you have joy of the sight my good dwarf f said gandalf but whatever you may do we at least cannot stay in that valley we must go down the silverlode into the secret woods and so to the great river and then f he paused yes and where then asked merry to the end of the journey  in the end said gandalf we cannot look too far ahead let us be glad that the first stage is safely over i think we will rest here not only today but tonight as well there is a wholesome air about hollin much evil must UNK a country before it wholly UNK the elves if once they dwelt there that is true said legolas but the elves of this land were of a race strange to us of the UNK folk and the trees and the grass do not now remember them only i hear the stones UNK them deep they UNK us fair they wrought us high they UNK us but they are gone they are gone they sought the UNK long ago that morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes of holly and their supper UNK was UNK than it had been since they set out they did not hurry to bed afterwards for they expected to have all the night to sleep in and they did not mean to go on again until the evening of the next day only aragorn was silent and restless after a while he left the company and wandered on to the ridge there he stood in the shadow of a tree looking out southwards and westwards with his head UNK as if he was listening then he returned to the brink of the dell and looked down at the others laughing and talking what is the matter strider merry called up what are you looking for do you miss the east wind no indeed he answered but i miss something i have been in the country of hollin in many UNK no folk dwell here now but many other creatures live here at all times especially birds yet now all things but you are silent i can feel it there is no sound for miles about us and your voices seem to make the ground echo i do not understand it gandalf looked up with sudden interest but what do you guess is the reason he asked is there more in it than surprise at seeing four hobbits not to mention the rest of us where people are so seldom seen or heard i hope that is it answered aragorn but i have a sense of UNK and of fear that i have never had here before then we must be more careful said gandalf if you bring a ranger with you it is well to pay attention to him especially if the ranger is aragorn we must stop talking aloud rest quietly and set the watch it was sams turn that day to take the first watch but aragorn joined him the others fell asleep then the silence grew until even sam felt it the breathing of the UNK could be plainly heard the UNK of the ponys tail and the UNK movements of his feet became loud noises sam could hear his own UNK creaking if he stirred dead silence was around him and over all hung a clear blue sky as the sun rode up from the east away in the south a dark patch appeared and grew and drove north like flying smoke in the wind whats that strider it dont look like a cloud said sam in a whisper to aragorn he made no answer he was gazing intently at the sky but before long sam could see for himself what was approaching UNK of birds flying at great speed were UNK and circling and UNK all the land as if they were searching for something and they were steadily drawing nearer lie flat and still hissed aragorn pulling sam down into the shade of a holly UNK for a whole UNK of birds had broken away suddenly from the main host and came flying low straight towards the ridge sam thought they were a kind of UNK of large size as they passed overhead in so UNK a UNK that their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below one harsh UNK was heard not until they had dwindled into the distance north and west and the sky was again clear would aragorn rise then he sprang up and went and UNK gandalf UNK of black UNK are flying over all the land between the mountains and the greyflood he said and they have passed over hollin they are not UNK here they are UNK out of fangorn and UNK i do not know what they are about possibly there is some trouble away south from which they are UNK but i think they are UNK out the land i have also glimpsed many UNK flying high up in the sky i think we ought to move again this evening hollin is no longer wholesome for us it is being watched and in that case so is the redhorn gate said gandalf and how we can get over that without being seen i cannot imagine but we will think of that when we must as for moving as soon as it is dark i am afraid that you are right UNK our fire made little smoke and had burned low before the UNK came said aragorn it must be put out and not lit again well if that isnt a plague and a nuisance said pippin the news no fire and a move again by night had been broken to him as soon as he woke in the late afternoon all because of a pack of UNK i had looked forward to a real good meal tonight something hot well you can go on looking forward said gandalf there may be many unexpected UNK ahead for you for myself i should like a pipe to smoke in comfort and warmer feet however we are certain of one thing at any rate it will get warmer as we get south too warm i shouldnt wonder muttered sam to frodo but im beginning to think its time we got a sight of that fiery mountain and saw the end of the road so to speak i thought at first that this here redhorn or whatever its name is might be it till gimli spoke his piece a fair UNK UNK must be maps UNK nothing to sams mind and all UNK in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite out of his reckoning all that day the company remained in hiding the dark birds passed over now and again but as the westering sun grew red they disappeared southwards at dusk the company set out and turning now half east they steered their course towards caradhras which far away still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished sun one by one white stars sprang forth as the sky faded guided by aragorn they struck a good path it looked to frodo like the remains of an ancient road that had once been broad and well UNK from hollin to the UNK the moon now at the full rose over the mountains and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black many of them looked to have been UNK by hands though now they lay tumbled and UNK in a bleak barren land it was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn and the moon was low frodo looked up at the sky suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the high stars as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out again he shivered did you see anything pass over he whispered to gandalf who was just ahead no but i felt it whatever it was he answered it may be nothing only a UNK of thin cloud it was moving fast then muttered aragorn and not with the wind nothing further happened that night the next morning dawned even brighter than before but the air was chill again already the wind was turning back towards the east for two more nights they marched on climbing steadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills and the mountains towered up nearer and nearer on the third morning caradhras rose before them a mighty peak tipped with snow like silver but with sheer naked sides dull red as if stained with blood there was a black look in the sky and the sun was UNK the wind had gone now round to the UNK gandalf UNK the air and looked back winter UNK behind us he said quietly to aragorn the heights away north are UNK than they were snow is lying far down their shoulders tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the redhorn gate we may well be seen by UNK on that narrow path and UNK by some evil but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any what do you think of your course now aragorn frodo UNK these words and understood that gandalf and aragorn were UNK some debate that had begun long before he listened anxiously i think no good of our course from beginning to end as you know well gandalf answered aragorn and perils known and unknown will grow as we go on but we must go on and it is no good our UNK the passage of the mountains further south there are no passes till one comes to the gap of rohan i do not trust that way since your news of saruman who knows which side now the UNK of the UNK serve who knows indeed said gandalf but there is another way and not by the pass of caradhras the dark and secret way that we have spoken of but let us not speak of it again not yet say nothing to the others i beg not until it is plain that there is no other way we must decide before we go further answered gandalf then let us UNK the matter in our minds while the others rest and sleep said aragorn in the late afternoon while the others were UNK their breakfast gandalf and aragorn went aside together and stood looking at caradhras its sides were now dark and UNK and its head was in grey cloud frodo watched them wondering which way the debate would go when they returned to the company gandalf spoke and then he knew that it had been decided to face the weather and the high pass he was relieved he could not guess what was the other dark and secret way but the very mention of it had seemed to fill aragorn with dismay and frodo was glad that it had been UNK from signs that we have seen lately said gandalf i fear that the redhorn gate may be watched and also i have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind snow may come we must go with all the speed that we can even so it will take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the pass dark will come early this evening we must leave as soon as you can get ready i will UNK a word of advice if i may said boromir i was born under the shadow of the white mountains and know something of journeys in the high places we shall meet bitter cold if no worse before we come down on the other side it will not help us to keep so secret that we are frozen to death when we leave here where there are still a few trees and bushes each of us should carry a UNK of wood as large as he can bear and bill could take a bit more couldnt you lad said sam the pony looked at him UNK very well said gandalf but we must not use the wood  not unless it is a choice between fire and death the company set out again with good speed at first but soon their way became steep and difficult the UNK and climbing road had in many places almost disappeared and was blocked with many fallen stones the night grew deadly dark under great clouds a bitter wind swirled among the rocks by midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains the narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left above which the grim UNK of caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom on the right was a UNK of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine UNK they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the top frodo felt a soft touch on his face he put out his arm and saw the dim white flakes of snow UNK on his UNK they went on but before long the snow was falling fast filling all the air and swirling into frodos eyes the dark bent shapes of gandalf and aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen i dont like this at all UNK sam just behind UNK all right on a fine morning but i like to be in bed while its falling i wish this lot would go off to hobbiton folk might welcome it there except on the high moors of the UNK a heavy fall was rare in the shire and was regarded as a pleasant event and a chance for fun no living hobbit save bilbo could remember the fell winter of   when the white wolves UNK the shire over the frozen brandywine gandalf halted snow was thick on his hood and shoulders it was already UNK about his boots this is what i feared he said what do you say now aragorn that i feared it too aragorn answered but less than other things i knew the risk of snow though it seldom falls heavily so far south save high up in the mountains but we are not high yet we are still far down where the paths are usually open all the winter i wonder if this is a UNK of the enemy said boromir they say in my land that he can UNK the UNK in the mountains of shadow that stand upon the borders of mordor he has strange powers and many allies his arm has grown long indeed said gimli if he can draw snow down from the north to trouble us here three hundred leagues away his arm has grown long said gandalf while they were halted the wind died down and the snow UNK until it almost ceased they UNK on again but they had not gone more than a UNK when the storm returned with fresh UNK the wind whistled and the snow became a blinding UNK soon even boromir found it hard to keep going the hobbits bent nearly double UNK along behind the taller folk but it was plain that they could not go much further if the snow continued frodos feet felt like lead pippin was UNK behind even gimli as stout as any dwarf could be was UNK as he trudged the company halted suddenly as if they had come to an UNK without any words being spoken they heard UNK noises in the darkness round them it may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and UNK of the rocky wall but the sounds were those of shrill cries and wild howls of laughter stones began to fall from the UNK whistling over their heads or UNK on the path beside them every now and again they heard a dull UNK as a great UNK rolled down from hidden heights above we cannot go further tonight said boromir let those call it the wind who will there are fell voices on the air and these stones are UNK at us i do call it the wind said aragorn but that does not make what you say UNK there are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have little love for those that go on two legs and yet are not in league with sauron but have purposes of their own some have been in this world longer than he caradhras was called the cruel and had an ill name said gimli long years ago when rumour of sauron had not been heard in these lands it matters little who is the enemy if we cannot beat off his attack said gandalf but what can we do cried pippin UNK he was leaning on merry and frodo and he was shivering either stop where we are or go back said gandalf it is no good going on only a little higher if i remember rightly this path leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shallow UNK at the bottom of a long hard slope we should have no shelter there from snow or stones  or anything else and it is no good going back while the storm holds said aragorn we have passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter than this UNK we are under now shelter muttered sam if this is shelter then one wall and no roof make a house the company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could it faced southwards and near the bottom it leaned out a little so that they hoped it would give them some protection from the UNK wind and from the falling stones but UNK UNK swirled round them from every side and the snow flowed down in ever UNK clouds they huddled together with their backs to the wall bill the pony stood UNK but UNK in front of the hobbits and UNK them a little but before long the UNK snow was above his UNK and it went on mounting if they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon have been entirely buried a great sleepiness came over frodo he felt himself sinking fast into a warm and UNK dream he thought a fire was UNK his toes and out of the shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard bilbos voice speaking  don t think much of your UNK  he said UNK on UNK the UNK there was no need to come back to report that but i wanted rest and sleep bilbo  frodo answered with an effort when he felt himself shaken and he came back UNK to UNK boromir had lifted him off the ground out of a UNK of snow this will be the death of the halflings gandalf said boromir it is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads we must do something to save ourselves give them this said gandalf searching in his pack and drawing out a UNK UNK just a UNK each  for all of us it is very precious it is UNK the UNK of imladris elrond gave it to me at our parting pass it round as soon as frodo had UNK a little of the warm and fragrant UNK he felt a new strength of heart and the heavy UNK left his limbs the others also UNK and found fresh hope and vigour but the snow did not UNK it UNK about them thicker than ever and the wind blew louder what do you say to fire asked boromir suddenly the choice seems near now between fire and death gandalf doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us but that will not help us you may make a fire if you can answered gandalf if there are any UNK that can endure this storm then they can see us fire or no but though they had brought wood and UNK by the advice of boromir it passed the skill of elf or even dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel at last reluctantly gandalf himself took a hand picking up a UNK he held it aloft for a moment and then with a word of command UNK an UNK UNK  he thrust the end of his staff into the midst of it at once a great UNK of green and blue flame sprang out and the wood flared and UNK if there are any to see then i at least am revealed to them he said i have written gandalf is here in signs that all can read from rivendell to the mouths of anduin but the company UNK no longer for UNK or unfriendly eyes their hearts were UNK to see the light of the fire the wood burned merrily and though all round it the snow hissed and pools of UNK crept under their feet they UNK their hands gladly at the blaze there they stood stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames a red light was on their tired and anxious faces behind them the night was like a black wall but the wood was burning fast and the snow still fell the fire burned low and the last UNK was thrown on the night is getting old said aragorn the dawn is not far off if any dawn can pierce these clouds said gimli boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the UNK the snow is growing less he said and the wind is UNK frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire but for a long time he could see no sign of their UNK then suddenly as sleep was beginning to creep over him again he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen and the flakes were becoming larger and UNK very slowly a dim light began to grow at last the snow stopped altogether as the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world below their refuge were white UNK and UNK and shapeless deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden was altogether lost but the heights above were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow gimli looked up and shook his head caradhras has not UNK us he said he has more snow yet to fling at us if we go on the sooner we go back and down the better to this all agreed but their UNK was now difficult it might well prove impossible only a few UNK from the ashes of their fire the snow lay many feet deep higher than the heads of the hobbits in places it had been UNK and piled by the wind into great UNK against the cliff if gandalf would go before us with a bright flame he might melt a path for you said legolas the storm had troubled him little and he alone of the company remained still light of heart if elves could fly over mountains they might fetch the sun to save us answered gandalf but i must have something to work on i cannot UNK snow well said boromir when heads are at a loss bodies must serve as we say in my country the UNK of us must seek a way see though all is now UNK our path as we came up turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder it was there that the snow first began to burden us if we could reach that point maybe it would prove easier beyond it is no more than a UNK off i guess then let us force a path thither you and i said aragorn aragorn was the UNK of the company but boromir little less in height was broader and heavier in build he led the way and aragorn followed him slowly they moved off and were soon UNK heavily in places the snow was UNK and often boromir seemed to be swimming or UNK with his great arms rather than walking legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips and then he turned to the others the UNK must seek a way say you but i say let a UNK UNK but choose an UNK for swimming and for running light over grass and leaf or over UNK elf with that he sprang forth UNK and then frodo noticed as if for the first time though he had long known it that the elf had no boots but wore only light shoes as he always did and his feet made little UNK in the snow farewell he said to gandalf i go to find the sun then swift as a UNK over firm UNK he shot away and quickly UNK the UNK men with a wave of his hand he passed them and sped into the distance and vanished round the rocky turn the others waited huddled together watching until boromir and aragorn dwindled into black specks in the UNK at length they too passed from sight the time dragged on the clouds UNK and now a few flakes of snow came curling down again an hour maybe went by though it seemed far longer and then at last they saw legolas coming back at the same time boromir and aragorn reappeared round the bend far behind him and came UNK up the slope well cried legolas as he ran up i have not brought the sun she is walking in the blue fields of the south and a little UNK of snow on this redhorn UNK troubles her not at all but i have brought back a gleam of good hope for those who are UNK to go on feet there is the greatest UNK of all just beyond the turn and there our strong men were almost buried they despaired until i returned and told them that the drift was little wider than a wall and on the other side the snow suddenly grows less while further down it is no more than a white UNK to cool a hobbits toes ah it is as i said UNK gimli it was no ordinary storm it is the ill will of caradhras he does not love elves and dwarves and that drift was laid to cut off our escape but happily your caradhras has forgotten that you have men with you said boromir who came up at that moment and UNK men too if i may say it though lesser men with UNK might have served you better still we have thrust a lane through the drift and for that all here may be grateful who cannot run as light as elves but how are we to get down there even if you have cut through the drift said pippin UNK the thought of all the hobbits have hope said boromir i am weary but i still have some strength left and aragorn too we will bear the little folk the others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us come master peregrin i will begin with you he lifted up the hobbit UNK to my back i shall need my arms he said and strode forward aragorn with merry came behind pippin UNK at his strength seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other UNK than his great limbs even now UNK as he was he was widening the track for those who followed UNK the snow aside as he went they came at length to the great drift it was flung across the UNK like a sheer and sudden wall and its UNK sharp as if shaped with knives reared up more than twice the height of boromir but through the middle a passage had been beaten rising and falling like a bridge on the far side merry and pippin were set down and there they waited with legolas for the rest of the company to UNK after a while boromir returned carrying sam behind in the narrow but now UNK track came gandalf leading bill with gimli UNK among the baggage last came aragorn carrying frodo they passed through the lane but hardly had frodo touched the ground when with a deep UNK there rolled down a fall of stones and UNK snow the UNK of it half UNK the company as they crouched against the cliff and when the air cleared again they saw that the path was blocked behind them enough enough cried gimli we are departing as quickly as we may and indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be UNK as if caradhras was UNK that the UNK had been beaten off and would not dare to return the threat of snow lifted the clouds began to break and the light grew broader as legolas had reported they found that the snow became steadily more shallow as they went down so that even the hobbits could UNK along soon they all stood once more on the flat UNK at the head of the steep slope where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before the morning was now far advanced from the high place they looked back westwards over the lower lands far away in the UNK of country that lay at the foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to climb the pass frodos legs UNK he was chilled to the bone and hungry and his head was UNK as he thought of the long and painful march downhill black specks swam before his eyes he rubbed them but the black specks remained in the distance below him but still high above the lower foothills dark UNK were circling in the air the birds again said aragorn pointing down that cannot be helped now said gandalf whether they are good or evil or have nothing to do with us at all we must go down at once not even on the knees of caradhras will we wait for another UNK a cold wind flowed down behind them as they turned their backs on the redhorn gate and stumbled wearily down the slope caradhras had defeated them chapter   a journey in the dark it was evening and the grey light was again waning fast when they halted for the night they were very weary the mountains were veiled in UNK dusk and the wind was cold gandalf UNK them one more UNK each of the UNK of rivendell when they had eaten some food he called a council we cannot of course go on again tonight he said the attack on the redhorn gate has tired us out and we must rest here for a while and then where are we to go  asked frodo we still have our journey and our errand before us answered gandalf we have no choice but to go on or to return to rivendell UNK face UNK UNK at the mere mention of return to rivendell merry and sam looked up hopefully but aragorn and boromir made no sign frodo looked troubled i wish i was back there he said but how can i return without UNK  unless there is indeed no other way and we are already defeated  you are right frodo said gandalf to go back is to admit defeat and face worse defeat to come if we go back now then the ring must remain there we shall not be able to set out again then sooner or later rivendell will be UNK and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed the ringwraiths are deadly enemies but they are only shadows yet of the power and terror they would possess if the ruling ring was on their masters hand again then we must go on if there is a way said frodo with a UNK sam sank back into gloom there is a way that we may attempt said gandalf i thought from the beginning when first i considered this journey that we should try it but it is not a pleasant way and i have not spoken of it to the company before aragorn was against it until the pass over the mountains had at least been tried if it is a worse road than the redhorn gate then it must be evil indeed said merry but you had better tell us about it and let us know the worst at once the road that i speak of UNK to the mines of moria said gandalf only gimli lifted up his head a UNK fire was in his eyes on all the others a dread fell at the mention of that name even to the hobbits it was a legend of vague fear the road may lead to moria but how can we hope that it will lead through moria  said aragorn darkly it is a name of ill UNK said boromir nor do i see the need to go there if we cannot cross the mountains let us journey southwards until we come to the gap of rohan where men are friendly to my people taking the road that i followed on my way hither or we might pass by and cross the UNK into UNK and UNK and so come to gondor from the regions nigh to the sea things have changed since you came north boromir answered gandalf did you not hear what i told you of saruman with him i may have business of my own ere all is over but the ring must not come near isengard if that can by any means be prevented the gap of rohan is closed to us while we go with the bearer as for the longer road we cannot afford the time we might spend a year in such a journey and we should pass through many lands that are empty and UNK yet they would not be safe the watchful eyes both of saruman and of the enemy are on them when you came north boromir you were in the UNK eyes only one stray UNK from the south and a matter of small concern to him his mind was busy with the pursuit of the ring but you return now as a member of the rings company and you are in peril as long as you remain with us the danger will UNK with every league that we go south under the naked sky since our open attempt on the mountain UNK our plight has become more desperate i fear i see now little hope if we do not soon vanish from sight for a while and cover our trail therefore i advise that we should go neither over the mountains nor round them but under them that is a road at any rate that the enemy will least expect us to take we do not know what he UNK said boromir lie may watch all roads likely and unlikely in that case to enter moria would be to walk into a UNK hardly better than knocking at the gates of the dark tower itself the name of moria is black you speak of what you do not know when you UNK moria to the UNK of sauron answered gandalf i alone of you have ever been in the dungeons of the dark lord and only in his older and lesser dwelling in dol guldur those who pass the gates of UNK do not return but i would not lead you into moria if there were no hope of coming out again if there are ores there it may prove ill for us that is true but most of the ores of the misty mountains were scattered or destroyed in the battle of five armies the eagles report that ores are gathering again from afar but there is a hope that moria is still free there is even a chance that dwarves are there and that in some deep hall of his fathers balin son of UNK may be found however it may prove one must tread the path that need UNK i will tread the path with you gandalf  said gimli i will go and look on the halls of durin whatever may wait UNK you can find the doors that are shut good gimli  said gandalf you UNK me we will seek the hidden doors together and we will come through in the ruins of the dwarves a UNK head will be less easy to UNK than elves or men or hobbits yet it will not be the first time that i have been to moria i sought there long for thrbin son of thrur after he was lost i passed through and i came out again alive  i too once passed the dimrill gate said aragorn quietly but though i also came out again the memory is very evil i do not wish to enter moria a second time and i dont wish to enter it even once said pippin nor me muttered sam of course not  said gandalf who would but the question is who will follow me if i lead you there  i will said gimli eagerly i will said aragorn heavily you followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow and have said no word of blame i will follow your lead now  if this last warning does not move you it is not of the ring nor of us others that i am thinking now but of you gandalf and i say to you if you pass the doors of moria UNK  i will not go said boromir not unless the vote of the whole company is against me what do legolas and the little folk say the UNK voice surely should be heard  i do not wish to go to moria said legolas the hobbits said nothing sam looked at frodo at last frodo spoke i do not wish to go he said but neither do i wish to refuse the advice of gandalf i beg that there should be no vote until we have slept on it gandalf will get UNK easier in the light of the morning than in this cold gloom how the wind howls   at these words all fell into silent thought they heard the wind hissing among the rocks and trees and there was a howling and wailing round them in the empty UNK of the night suddenly aragorn leapt to his feet how the wind howls   he cried it is howling with UNK the UNK have come west of the mountains f need we wait until morning then  said gandalf it is as i said the hunt is up even if we live to see the dawn who now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolves on his trail  how far is moria  asked boromir there was a door south-west of caradhras some UNK miles as the UNK flies and maybe twenty as the wolf runs answered gandalf grimly then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow if we can said boromir the wolf that one UNK is worse than the ore that one fears true said aragorn UNK his sword in its sheath but where the UNK howls there also the ore UNK i wish i had taken elronds advice muttered pippin to sam i am no good after all there is not enough of the UNK of UNK the UNK in me these howls UNK my blood i dont ever remember feeling so wretched my hearts right down in my toes mr pippin said sam but we arent UNK yet and there are some stout folk here with us whatever may be in store for old gandalf ill UNK it isnt a UNK UNK for their defence in the night the company climbed to the top of the small hill under which they had been UNK it was crowned with a UNK of old and twisted trees about which lay a broken circle of UNK stones in the midst of this they lit a fire for there was no hope that darkness and silence would keep their trail from discovery by the hunting packs round the fire they sat and those that were not on guard UNK uneasily poor bill the pony UNK and UNK where he stood the howling of the wolves was now all round them sometimes nearer and sometimes further off in the dead of the night many shining eyes were seen peering over the brow of the hill some advanced almost to the ring of stones at a gap in the circle a great dark UNK could be seen halted gazing at them a UNK UNK broke from him as if he were a captain UNK his pack to the UNK gandalf stood up and strode forward holding his staff aloft listen UNK of sauron  he cried gandalf is here fly if you UNK your foul skin i will UNK you from tail to UNK if you come within this ring the wolf UNK and sprang towards them with a great leap at that moment there was a sharp UNK legolas had UNK his bow there was a hideous yell and the leaping shape UNK to the ground the elvish arrow had pierced its throat the watching eyes were suddenly UNK gandalf and aragorn strode forward but the hill was deserted the hunting packs had fled all about them the darkness grew silent and no cry came on the sighing wind the night was old and westward the waning moon was setting gleaming UNK through the breaking clouds suddenly frodo started from sleep without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the camp a great host of UNK had gathered silently and was now UNK them from every side at once fling fuel on the fire cried gandalf to the hobbits draw your blades and stand back to back in the leaping light as the fresh wood UNK up frodo saw many grey shapes spring over the ring of stones more and more followed through the throat of one huge leader aragorn passed his sword with a thrust with a great sweep boromir hewed the head off another beside them gimli stood with his stout legs apart UNK his UNK the bow of legolas was singing in the UNK firelight gandalf seemed suddenly to grow he rose up a great menacing shape like the UNK of some ancient king of stone set upon a hill stooping like a cloud he lifted a burning branch and strode to meet the wolves they gave back before him high in the air he tossed the blazing brand it flared with a sudden white UNK like lightning and his voice rolled like thunder  UNK an UNK UNK UNK UNK i UNK he cried there was a roar and a UNK and the tree above him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame the fire leapt from UNK to tree -top the whole hill was crowned with UNK light the swords and knives of the UNK shone and flickered the last arrow of legolas kindled in the air as it flew and plunged burning into the heart of a great UNK all the others fled slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and UNK a bitter smoke curled above the burned UNK and blew darkly from the hill as the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky their enemies were UNK and did not return what did i tell you mr pippin  said sam UNK his sword wolves wont get him that was an UNK and no mistake nearly UNK the hair off my head when the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to be found and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead no trace of the fight remained but the UNK trees and the arrows of legolas lying on the hill-top all were UNK save one of which only the point was left it is as i feared said gandalf these were no ordinary wolves hunting for food in the wilderness let us eat quickly and go that day the weather changed again almost as if it was at the command of some power that had no longer any use for snow since they had retreated from the pass a power that wished now to have a clear light in which things that moved in the wild could be seen from far away the wind had been turning through north to UNK during the night and now it failed the clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened high and blue as they stood upon the UNK ready to depart a pale sunlight gleamed over the UNK we must reach the doors before sunset said gandalf or i fear we shall not reach them at all it is not far but our path may be winding for here aragorn cannot guide us he has seldom walked in this country and only once have i been under the west wall of moria and that was long ago there it lies he said pointing away UNK to where the mountains sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet in the distance could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs and in their midst taller than the rest one great grey wall when we left the pass i led you southwards and not back to our starting point as some of you may have noticed it is well that i did so for now we have several miles less to cross and haste is needed let us go  i do not know which to hope said boromir grimly that gandalf will find what he UNK or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost for ever all UNK seem ill and to be caught between wolves and the wall the UNK chance lead on gimli now walked ahead by the wizards side so eager was he to come to moria together they led the company back towards the mountains the only road of old to moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream the sirannon that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors had stood but either gandalf was astray or else the land had changed in recent years for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it only a few miles southwards from their start the morning was passing towards noon and still the company wandered and scrambled in a barren country of red stones nowhere could they see any gleam of water or hear any sound of it all was bleak and dry their hearts sank they saw no living thing and not a bird was in the sky but what the night would bring if it caught them in that lost land none of them UNK to think suddenly gimli who had pressed on ahead called back to them he was standing on a UNK and pointing to the right hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow channel it was empty and silent and hardly a UNK of water flowed among the brown and UNK stones of its bed but on the near side there was a path much broken and UNK that wound its way among the ruined walls and UNK of an ancient UNK ah here it is at last  said gandalf this is where the stream ran sirannon the UNK they used to call it but what has happened to the water i cannot guess it used to be swift and UNK come we must hurry on we are late the company were UNK and tired but they trudged UNK along the rough and winding track for many miles the sun turned from the noon and began to go west after a brief halt and a UNK meal they went on again before them the mountains UNK but their path lay in a deep UNK of land and they could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward peaks at length they came to a sharp bend there the road which had been UNK southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the land to the left turned and went due east again UNK the corner they saw before them a low cliff some five UNK high with a broken and UNK top over it a UNK water UNK through a wide cleft that seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full indeed things have changed  said gandalf but there is no UNK the place there is all that remains of the stair falls if i remember right there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their side but the main road wound away left and climbed with several UNK up to the level ground at the top there used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right up to the walls of moria and the sirannon flowed through it with the road beside it let us go and see what things are like now   they found the stone steps without difficulty and gimli sprang swiftly up them followed by gandalf and frodo when they reached the top they saw that they could go no further that way and the reason for the UNK up of the UNK was revealed behind them the sinking sun filled the cool western sky with glimmering gold before them stretched a dark still lake neither sky nor sunset was UNK on its UNK surface the sirannon had been UNK and had filled all the valley beyond the ominous water were reared vast cliffs their stern faces UNK in the fading light final and UNK no sign of gate or entrance not a UNK or crack could frodo see in the UNK stone there are the walls of moria said gandalf pointing across the water and there the gate stood once upon a time the UNK door at the end of the road from UNK by which we have come but this way is blocked none of the company i guess will wish to swim this gloomy water at the end of the day it has an UNK look we must find a way round the northern edge said gimli the first thing for the company to do is to climb up by the main path and see where that will lead us even if there were no lake we could not get our UNK up this stair but in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the mines said gandalf the road under the mountains is a dark road and there are places narrow and steep which he cannot tread even if we can poor old bill  said frodo i had not thought of that and poor sam i wonder what he will say  i am sorry said gandalf poor bill has been a useful companion and it goes to my heart to turn him UNK now i would have travelled lighter and brought no animal least of all this one that sam is fond of if i had had my way i feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road the day was drawing to its end and cold stars were glinting in the sky high above the sunset when the company with all the speed they could climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake in UNK it looked to be no more than two or three UNK at the UNK point how far it stretched away southward they could not see in the failing light but its northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood and between the stony ridges that UNK the valley and the waters edge there was a rim of open ground they hurried forward for they had still a mile or two to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that gandalf was making for and then he had still to find the doors when they came to the UNK corner of the lake they found a narrow UNK that barred their way it was green and UNK thrust out like a slimy arm towards the UNK hills gimli strode forward UNK and found that the water was shallow no more than UNK at the edge behind him they walked in file UNK their way with care for under the UNK pools were UNK and UNK stones and UNK was treacherous frodo shuddered with UNK at the touch of the dark UNK water on his feet as sam the last of the company led bill up on to the dry ground on the far side there came a soft sound a UNK followed by a UNK as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water turning quickly they saw ripples UNK with shadow in the waning light great rings were widening outwards from a point far out in the lake there was a bubbling noise and then silence the dusk deepened and the last UNK of the sunset were veiled in cloud gandalf now pressed on at a great pace and the others followed as quickly as they could they reached the strip of dry land between the lake and the cliffs it was narrow often hardly a UNK yards across and UNK with fallen rock and stones but they found a way UNK the cliff and keeping as far from the dark water as they might a mile southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees UNK and dead boughs were UNK in the UNK the remains it seemed of old thickets or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley but close under the cliff there stood still strong and living  two tall trees larger than any trees of holly that frodo had ever seen or imagined their great roots spread from the wall to the water under the UNK cliffs they had looked like mere bushes when seen far off from the top of the stair but now they towered overhead stiff dark and silent throwing deep UNK about their feet standing like UNK pillars at the end of the road well here we are at last said gandalf here the UNK from hollin ended holly was the token of the people of that land and they planted it here to mark the end of their domain for the west UNK was made chiefly for their use in their traffic with the lords of moria those were happier days when there was still close friendship at times between folk of different race even between dwarves and elves it was not the fault of the dwarves that the friendship waned said gimli i have not heard that it was the fault of the elves said legolas i have heard both said gandalf and i will not give UNK now but i beg you two legolas and gimli at least to be friends and to help me i need you both the doors are shut and hidden and the sooner we find them the better night is at hand  turning to the others he said while i am searching will you each make ready to enter the mines for here i fear we must say farewell to our good beast of burden you must lay aside much of the stuff that we brought against bitter weather you will not need it inside nor i hope when we come through and journey on down into the south instead each of us must take a share of what the pony carried especially the food and the UNK but you cant leave poor old bill behind in this forsaken place mr gandalf  cried sam angry and UNK i wont have it and thats flat after he has come so far and all   i am sorry sam said the wizard but when the door opens i do not think you will be able to UNK your bill inside into the long dark of moria you will have to choose between bill and your master hed follow mr frodo into a dragons UNK if i led him UNK sam UNK be nothing short of murder to turn him loose with all these wolves about it will be short of murder i hope said gandalf he laid his hand on the ponys head and spoke in a low voice go with words of guard and UNK on you he said you are a wise beast and have learned much in rivendell make your ways to places where you can find grass and so come in time to elronds house or wherever you wish to go there sam he will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and getting home as we have sam stood UNK by the pony and returned no answer bill seeming to understand well what was going on UNK up to him putting his nose to sams ear sam burst into tears and UNK with the UNK UNK all the ponys packs and throwing them on the ground the others UNK out the goods making a pile of all that could be left behind and UNK up the rest when this was done they turned to watch gandalf he appeared to have done nothing he was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall of the cliff as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyes gimli was wandering about tapping the stone here and there with his axe legolas was pressed against the rock as if listening well here we are and all ready said merry but where are the doors i cant see any sign of them UNK are not made to be seen when shut said gimli they are invisible and their own masters cannot find them or open them if their secret is forgotten but this door was not made to be a secret known only to dwarves said gandalf coming suddenly to life and turning round unless things are altogether changed eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs he walked forward to the wall right between the shadow of the trees there was a smooth space and over this he passed his hands to and fro muttering words under his breath then he stepped back look he said can you see anything now the moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock but they could see nothing else for a while then slowly on the surface where the wizards hands had passed faint lines appeared like slender UNK of silver running in the stone at first they were no more than pale UNK so fine that they only twinkled UNK where the moon caught them but steadily they grew broader and clearer until their UNK could be guessed at the top as high as gandalf could reach was an arch of UNK letters in an elvish character below though the UNK were in places blurred or broken the UNK could be seen of an anvil and a hammer UNK by a crown with seven stars beneath these again were two trees each bearing UNK UNK more clearly than all else there shone forth in the middle of the door a single star with many UNK there are the UNK of UNK cried gimli and there is the tree of the high elves said legolas and the star of the house of UNK said gandalf they are wrought of UNK that UNK only starlight and moonlight and UNK until it is touched by one who UNK words now long forgotten in middle-earth it is long since i heard them and i thought deeply before i could recall them to my mind what does the writing say asked frodo who was trying to UNK the UNK on the arch i thought i knew the UNK but i cannot read these the words are in the elven-tongue of the west of middle-earth in the elder days answered gandalf but they do not say anything of importance to us they say only the doors UNK lord UNK speak friend and enter and UNK small and faint is written i UNK made them UNK UNK drew these signs what does it mean by speak friend and enter asked merry that is plain enough said gimli if you are a friend speak the UNK and the doors will open and you can enter yes said gandalf these doors are probably UNK by words some UNK will open only at special times or for UNK UNK and some have UNK and UNK that are still needed when all necessary times and words are known these doors have no key in the days of durin they were not secret they usually stood open and UNK sat here but if they were shut any who knew the opening word could speak it and pass in at least so it is UNK is it not gimli  it is said the dwarf but what the word was is not remembered UNK and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth but do not you know the word gandalf  asked boromir in surprise no  said the wizard the others looked dismayed only aragorn who knew gandalf well remained silent and UNK then what was the use of bringing us to this UNK spot cried boromir glancing back with a UNK at the dark water you told us that you had once passed through the mines how could that be if you did not know how to enter  the answer to your first question boromir said the wizard is that i do not know the UNK but we shall soon see and he added with a glint in his eyes under their bristling brows you may ask what is the use of my deeds when they are proved useless as for your other question do you doubt my tale or have you no wits left i did not enter this way i came from the east if you wish to know i will tell you that these doors open outwards from the inside you may thrust them open with your hands from the outside nothing will move them save the spell of command they cannot be forced inwards what are you going to do then  asked pippin UNK by the wizards bristling brows knock on the doors with your head peregrin took said gandalf but if that does not UNK them and i am allowed a little peace from foolish questions i will seek for the opening words i once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves or men or ores that was ever used for such a purpose i can still remember ten UNK of them without searching in my mind but only a few UNK i think will be needed and i shall not have to call on gimli for words of the secret UNK that they UNK to none the opening words were elvish like the writing on the arch that seems certain ele stepped up to the rock again and lightly touched with his staff the silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK he said in a commanding voice the silver lines faded but the blank grey stone did not stir many times he repeated these words in different order or UNK them then he tried other UNK one after another speaking now faster and louder now soft and slow then he spoke many single words of elvish speech nothing happened the cliff towered into the night the countless stars were kindled the wind blew cold and the doors stood fast again gandalf approached the wall and lifting up his arms he spoke in UNK of command and rising wrath UNK UNK he cried and struck the rock with his staff open open he shouted and followed it with the same command in every language that had ever been spoken in the west of middle-earth then he threw his staff on the ground and sat down in silence at that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears the howling of wolves bill the pony started in fear and sam sprang to his side and whispered softly to him do not let him run away  said boromir it seems that we shall need him still if the wolves do not find us how i hate this foul pool  he stooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water the stone vanished with a soft UNK but at the same instant there was a UNK and a UNK great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond where the stone had fallen and they moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff why did you do that boromir  said frodo v i hate this place too and i am afraid i dont know of what not of wolves or the dark behind the doors but of something else i am afraid of the pool dont UNK it   wish we could get away  said merry why doesnt gandalf do something quick  said pippin gandalf took no notice of them he sat with his head bowed either in despair or in anxious thought the UNK howling of the wolves was heard again the ripples on the water grew and came closer some were already UNK on the shore with a UNK that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet he was laughing v i have it  he cried of course of course UNK simple like most riddles when you see the answer picking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear voice UNK the star shone out briefly and faded again then silently a great doorway was UNK though not a crack or UNK had been visible before slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch until both doors lay back against the wall through the opening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing steeply up but beyond the lower steps the darkness was deeper than the night the company stared in wonder v i was wrong after all said gandalf and gimli too merry of all people was on the right track the opening word was UNK on the archway all the time the UNK should have been say friend and enter i had only to speak the elvish word for friend and the doors opened quite simple too simple for a learned UNK in these suspicious days those were happier times now let us go he strode forward and set his foot on the UNK step but at that moment several things happened frodo felt something UNK him by the UNK and he fell with a cry bill the pony gave a wild UNK of fear and turned tail and dashed away along the UNK into the darkness sam leaped after him and then hearing frodos cry he ran back again weeping and cursing the others swung round and saw the waters of the lake UNK as if a host of snakes were swimming up from the southern end out from the water a long UNK UNK had crawled it was UNK and UNK and wet its UNK end had hold of frodos foot and was UNK him into the water sam on his knees was now UNK at it with a knife the arm let go of frodo and sam pulled him away crying out for help twenty others arms came rippling out the dark water UNK and there was a hideous UNK into the UNK up the stairs quick  shouted gandalf leaping back UNK them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but sam to the ground where they stood he drove them forward they were just in time sam and frodo were only a few steps up and gandalf had just begun to climb when the groping UNK UNK across the narrow shore and UNK the UNK wall and the doors one came UNK over the threshold glistening in the starlight gandalf turned and paused if he was considering what word would close the gate again from within there was no need many UNK arms seized the doors on either side and with horrible strength swung them round with a UNK echo they UNK and all light was lost a noise of UNK and UNK came UNK through the UNK stone sam UNK to frodos arm UNK on a step in the black darkness poor old bill  he said in a UNK voice poor old bill wolves and snakes but the snakes were too much for him i had to choose mr frodo i had to come with you they heard gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the doors there was a quiver in the stone and the stairs UNK but the doors did not open well well  said the wizard the passage is blocked behind us now and there is only one way out on the other side of the mountains i fear from the sounds that UNK have been piled up and the trees UNK and thrown across the gate i am sorry for the trees were beautiful and had stood so long i felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot first touched the water said frodo what was the thing or were there many of them  i do not know answered gandalf but the arms were all guided by one purpose something has crept or has been driven out of dark waters under the mountains there are older and UNK things than ores in the deep places of the world he did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it was that dwelt in the lake it had seized on frodo first among all the company boromir muttered under his breath but the echoing stone UNK the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear in the deep places of the world and thither we are going against my wish who will lead us UNK this deadly dark  i will said gandalf and gimli shall walk with me follow my staff t as the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps he held his staff aloft and from its UNK there came a faint UNK the wide UNK was sound and UNK two hundred steps they UNK broad and shallow and at the top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading on into the dark let us sit and rest and have something to eat here on the landing since we cant find a UNK  said frodo he had begun to shake off the terror of the clutching arm and suddenly he felt UNK hungry the UNK was welcomed by all and they sat down on the upper steps dim figures in the gloom after they had eaten gandalf gave them each a third UNK of the UNK of rivendell it will not last much longer i am afraid he said but i think we need it after that horror at the gate and unless we have great luck we shall need all that is left before we see the other side go carefully with the water too there are many streams and wells in the mines but they should not be touched we may not have a chance of filling our UNK and bottles till we come down into dimrill dale how long is that going to take us  asked frodo i cannot say answered gandalf it depends on many UNK but going straight without UNK or UNK our way we shall take three or four marches i expect it cannot be less than forty miles from west UNK to UNK in a direct line and the road may wind much after only a brief rest they started on their way again all were eager to get the journey over as quickly as possible and were willing tired as they were to go on UNK still for several hours gandalf walked in front as before in his left hand he held up his glimmering staff the light of which just showed the ground before his feet in his right he held his sword glamdring behind him came gimli his eyes glinting in the dim light as he turned his head from side to side behind the dwarf walked frodo and he had drawn the short sword sting no gleam came from the blades of sting or of glamdring and that was some comfort for being the work of elvish smiths in the elder days these swords shone with a cold light if any ores were near at hand behind frodo went sam and after him legolas and the young hobbits and boromir in the dark at the rear grim and silent walked aragorn the passage twisted round a few turns and then began to UNK it went steadily down for a long while before it became level once again the air grew hot and UNK but it was not foul and at times they felt UNK of UNK air upon their faces UNK from UNK UNK in the walls there were many of these in the pale UNK of the wizards staff frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages and tunnels sloping up or running steeply down or opening UNK dark on either side it was UNK beyond hope of remembering gimli aided gandalf very little except by his stout courage at least he was not as were most of the others troubled by the mere darkness in itself often the wizard UNK him at points where the choice of way was doubtful but it was always gandalf who had the final word the mines of moria were vast and UNK beyond the UNK of gimli UNK son dwarf of the UNK though he was to gandalf the UNK memories of a journey long before were now of little help but even in the gloom and UNK all UNK of the road he knew whither he wished to go and he did not falter as long as there was a path that led towards his UNK do not be afraid  said aragorn there was a UNK longer than usual and gandalf and gimli were whispering together the others were crowded behind waiting anxiously do not be afraid i have been with him on many a journey if never on one so dark and there are tales of rivendell of greater deeds of his than any that i have seen he will not go UNK there is any path to find he has led us in here against our fears but he will lead us out again at whatever UNK to himself he is UNK of finding the way home in a blind night than the UNK of queen UNK it was well for the company that they had such a guide they had no fuel nor any means of making UNK in the desperate UNK at the doors many things had been left behind but without any light they would soon have come to grief there were not only many roads to choose from there were also in many places holes and UNK and dark wells beside the path in which their passing feet UNK there were UNK and UNK in the walls and floor and every now and then a crack would open right before their feet the UNK was more than seven feet across and it was long before pippin could UNK enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap the noise of UNK water came up from far below as if some great UNK was turning in the depths rope  muttered sam i knew id want it if i hadnt got it  as these dangers became more UNK their march became slower already they seemed to have been tramping on on endlessly to the mountains roots they were more than weary and yet there seemed no comfort in the thought of UNK anywhere frodos spirits had risen for a while after his escape and after food and a draught of the UNK but now a deep UNK growing to dread crept over him again though he had been healed in rivendell of the UNK that grim wound had not been without effect his senses were UNK and more aware of things that could not be seen one sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could see more in the dark than any of his companions save perhaps gandalf and he was in any case the bearer of the ring it hung upon its chain against his breast and at UNK it seemed a heavy weight he felt the UNK of evil ahead and of evil following but he said nothing he gripped UNK on the hilt of his sword and went on UNK the company behind him spoke seldom and then only in hurried whispers there was no sound but the sound of their own feet the dull UNK of UNK UNK the heavy tread of boromir the light step of legolas the soft UNK UNK of UNK and in the rear the slow firm UNK of aragorn with his long UNK when they halted for a moment they heard nothing at all unless it were occasionally a faint UNK and UNK of unseen water yet frodo began to hear or to imagine that he heard something else like the faint fall of soft bare feet it was never loud enough or near enough for him to feel certain that he heard it but once it had started it never stopped while the company was moving but it was not an echo for when they halted it UNK on for a little all by itself and then grew still it was after nightfall when they had entered the mines they had been going for several hours with only brief UNK when gandalf came to his first serious UNK before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three passages all led in the same general direction eastwards but the UNK passage plunged down while the UNK climbed up and the middle way seemed to run on smooth and level but very narrow i have no memory of this place at all said gandalf standing UNK under the arch he held up his staff in the hope of finding some marks or UNK that might help his choice but nothing of the kind was to be seen i am too weary to decide he said shaking his head and i expect that you are all as weary as i am or UNK we had better halt here for what is left of the night you know what i mean in here it is ever dark but outside the late moon is riding westward and the UNK has passed poor old bill  said sam i wonder where he is i hope those wolves havent got him yet to the left of the great arch they found a stone door it was half closed but swung back easily to a gentle thrust beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock steady steady  cried gandalf as merry and pippin pushed forward glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of shelter than in the open passage steady you do not know what is inside yet i will go first he went in cautiously and the others UNK behind there  he said pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor before his feet they saw a large round hole like the mouth of a well broken and UNK chains lay at the edge and trailed down into the black pit UNK of stone lay near one of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were going to strike the bottom said aragorn to merry let the guide go first while you have one this seems to have been a UNK made for the watching of the three passages said gimli that hole was plainly a well for the guards use covered with a stone lid but the lid is broken and we must all take care in the dark pippin felt curiously UNK by the well while the others were UNK blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber as far as possible from the hole in the floor he crept to the edge and peered over a chill air seemed to strike his face rising from invisible depths moved by a sudden UNK he groped for a loose stone and let it drop he felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound then far below as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place there came a UNK  very distant but UNK and repeated in the hollow shaft whats that  cried gandalf he was relieved when pippin UNK what he had done but he was angry and pippin could see his eye glinting fool of a took  he UNK this is a serious journey not a hobbit walking UNK throw yourself in next time and then you will be no further nuisance now be quiet  nothing more was heard for several minutes but then there came out of the depths faint UNK UNK UNK they stopped and when the echoes had died away they were repeated UNK UNK UNK tom they sounded UNK like UNK of some sort but after a while the knocking died away and was not heard again that was the sound of a hammer or i have never heard one said gimli yes said gandalf and i do not like it it may have nothing to do with UNK foolish stone but probably something has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet pray do nothing of the kind again let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble you pippin can go on the first watch as a reward he UNK as he rolled himself in a blanket pippin sat UNK by the door in the UNK dark but he kept on turning round UNK that some unknown thing would UNK up out of the well he wished he could cover the hole if only with a blanket but he dared not move or go near it even though gandalf seemed to be asleep actually gandalf was awake though lying still and silent he was deep in thought trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the mines and considering anxiously the next course that he should take a false turn now might be UNK after an hour he rose up and came over to pippin get into a corner and have a sleep my lad he said in a kindly tone you want to sleep i expect i cannot get a UNK so i may as well do the watching i know what is the matter with me he muttered as he sat down by the door i need smoke  i have not UNK it since the morning before the UNK the last thing that pippin saw as sleep took him was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddled on the floor UNK a glowing UNK in his gnarled hands between his knees the UNK for a moment showed his sharp nose and the UNK of smoke it was gandalf who roused them all from sleep he had sat and watched all alone for about six hours and had let the others rest and in the UNK i have made up my mind he said i do not like the feel of the middle way and i do not like the smell of the UNK way there is foul air down there or i am no guide i shall take the UNK passage it is time we began to climb up again for eight dark hours not UNK two brief UNK they marched on and they met no danger and heard nothing and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the wizards light UNK like a UNK in front of them the passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards as far as they could judge it went in great mounting UNK and as it rose it grew UNK and wider there were now no UNK to other UNK or tunnels on either side and the floor was level and sound without UNK or cracks evidently they had struck what once had been an important road and they went forward quicker than they had done on their first march in this way they advanced some UNK miles UNK in a direct line east though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more as the road climbed upwards frodos spirits rose a little but he still felt UNK and still at times he heard or thought he heard away behind the company and beyond the fall and UNK of their feet a following UNK that was not an echo they had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest and all were thinking of a place where they could sleep when suddenly the walls to right and left vanished they seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into a black and empty space there was a great draught of warmer air behind them and before them the darkness was cold on their faces they halted and crowded anxiously together gandalf seemed pleased i chose the right way he said at last we are coming to the UNK parts and i guess that we are not far now from the eastern side but we are high up a good deal higher than the dimrill gate unless i am UNK from the feeling of the air we must be in a wide hall i will now risk a little real light he raised his staff and for a brief instant there was blaze like a flash of lightning great shadows sprang up and fled and for a second they saw a vast roof far above their heads UNK by many mighty pillars hewn of stone before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall its black walls polished and smooth as glass flashed and glittered three other UNK they saw dark black arches one straight before them eastwards and one on either side then the light went out that is all that i shall venture on for the present said gandalf there used to be great windows on the UNK and shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the mines i think we have reached them now but it is night outside again and we cannot tell until morning if i am right tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in but in the meanwhile we had better go no further let us rest if we can things have gone well so far and the greater part of the dark road is over but we are not through yet and it is a long way down to the gates that open on the world the company spent that night in the great cavernous hall huddled close together in a corner to escape the draught there seemed to be a steady UNK of chill air through the eastern archway all about them as they lay hung the darkness hollow and UNK and they were UNK by the loneliness and UNK of the UNK halls and endlessly branching stairs and passages the UNK UNK that dark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbits fell altogether short of the UNK dread and wonder of moria there must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time  said sam and every one of them UNK than UNK for five hundred years to make all this and most in hard rock too what did they do it all for they didnt live in these UNK holes surely  these are not holes said gimli this is the great realm and city of the UNK and of old it was not UNK but full of light and splendour as is still remembered in our songs he rose and standing in the dark he began to UNK in a deep voice while the echoes ran away into the roof the world was young the mountains green no UNK yet on the moon was seen no words were laid on stream or stone when durin woke and walked alone he named the nameless hills and dells he drank from yet UNK wells he stooped and looked in mirrormere and saw a crown of stars appear as gems upon a silver UNK above the shadow of his head the world was fair the mountains tall in elder days before the fall of mighty kings in UNK and gondolin who now beyond the western seas have passed away the world was fair in durin s day a king he was on carven throne in UNK halls of stone with golden roof and silver floor and runes of power upon the door the light of sun and star and moon in shining lamps of crystal hewn UNK by cloud or shade of night there shone for ever fair and bright there hammer on the anvil smote there UNK UNK and UNK wrote there forged was blade and bound was the UNK UNK the UNK built there UNK pearl and UNK pale and metal wrought like UNK mail UNK and corslet axe and sword and shining UNK were laid in UNK UNK then were durin s folk beneath the mountains music woke the UNK UNK the UNK sang and at the gates the UNK rang the world is grey the mountains old the UNK fire is UNK no UNK is UNK no hammer falls the darkness dwells in durin s halls the shadow lies upon his tomb in moria in khazad-dym but still the UNK stars appear in dark and UNK mirrormere there lies his crown in water deep till durin UNK again from sleep i like that  said sam v i should like to learn it in moria in khazad-dym  but it makes the darkness seem heavier thinking of all those lamps are there UNK of jewels and gold lying about here still  gimli was silent having sung his song he would say no more UNK of jewels  said gandalf no the ores have often UNK moria there is nothing left in the upper halls and since the dwarves fled no one UNK to seek the shafts and UNK down in the deep places they are drowned in water or in a shadow of fear then what do the dwarves want to come back for  asked sam for UNK answered gandalf the wealth of moria was not in gold and jewels the UNK of the dwarves nor in iron their servant such things they found here it is true especially iron but they did not need to UNK for them all things that they desired they could UNK in traffic for here alone in the world was found UNK or UNK as some have called it mithril is the elvish name the dwarves have a name which they do not tell its worth was ten times that of gold and now it is beyond price for little is left above ground and even the ores dare not UNK here for it the UNK lead away north towards caradhras and down to darkness the dwarves tell no tale but even as mithril was the UNK of their wealth so also it was their UNK they UNK too UNK and too deep and disturbed that from which they fled durins bane of what they brought to light the ores have gathered nearly all and given it in UNK to sauron who UNK it  mithril all folk desired it it could be beaten like UNK and polished like glass and the dwarves could make of it a metal light and yet harder than UNK steel its beauty was like to that of common silver but the beauty of mithril did not UNK or grow dim the elves dearly loved it and among many uses they made of it UNK  UNK which you saw upon the doors bilbo had a corslet of UNK that thorin gave him i wonder what has become of it gathering dust still in michel delving UNK i suppose what  cried gimli startled out of his silence a corslet of UNK silver that was a UNK gift  yes said gandalf i never told him but its worth was greater than the UNK of the whole shire and everything in it frodo said nothing but he put his hand under his UNK and touched the rings of his UNK he felt staggered to think that he had been walking about with the price of the shire under his jacket had bilbo known he felt no doubt that bilbo knew quite well it was indeed a UNK gift but now his thoughts had been carried away from the dark mines to rivendell to bilbo and to bag end in the days while bilbo was still there he wished with all his heart that he was back there and in those days UNK the lawn or UNK among the flowers and that he had never heard of moria or mithril  or the ring a deep silence fell one by one the others fell asleep frodo was on guard as if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep places dread came over him his hands were cold and his brow damp he listened all his mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow hours but he heard no sound not even the imagined echo of a UNK his watch was nearly over when far off where he guessed that the western archway stood he UNK that he could see two pale points of light almost like UNK eyes he started his head had nodded i must have nearly fallen asleep on guard he thought i was on the edge of a dream he stood up and rubbed his eyes and remained standing peering into the dark until he was relieved by legolas when he lay down he quickly went to sleep but it seemed to him that the dream went on he heard whispers and saw the two pale points of light approaching slowly he woke and found that the others were speaking softly near him and that a dim light was falling on his face high up above the eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam and across the hall through the northern arch light also UNK faint and UNK frodo sat up good morning said gandalf for morning it is again at last i was right you see we are high up on the east side of moria before today is over we ought to find the great gates and see the waters of mirrormere lying in the dimrill dale before us i shall be glad said gimli i have looked on moria and it is very great but it has become dark and dreadful and we have found no sign of my kindred i doubt now that balin ever came here after they had UNK gandalf decided to go on again at once we are tired but we shall rest better when we are outside he said i think that none of us will wish to spend another night in moria no indeed  said boromir which way shall we take yonder eastward arch  maybe said gandalf but i UNK not know yet exactly where we are unless i am quite astray i guess that we are above and to the north of the great gates and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them the eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take but before we make up our minds we ought to look about us let us go towards that light in the north door if we could find a window it would help but i fear that the light comes only down deep shafts following his lead the company passed under the northern arch they found themselves in a wide corridor as they went along it the glimmer grew stronger and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right it was high and UNK and the stone door was still upon its UNK standing half open beyond it was a large square chamber it was dimly lit but to their eyes after so long a time in the dark it seemed UNK bright and they UNK as they entered their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor and stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out the chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall it UNK upwards and far above a small square patch of blue sky could be seen the light of the shaft fell UNK on a table in the middle of the room a single UNK UNK about two feet high upon which was laid a great UNK of white stone it looks like a tomb muttered frodo and bent forwards with a curious sense of UNK to look more closely at it gandalf came quickly to his side on the UNK runes were deeply UNK these are UNK runes such as were used of old in moria said gandalf here is written in the tongues of men and dwarves balin son of UNK lord of moria he is dead then said frodo t feared it was so gimli cast his hood over his face chapter   the bridge of khazad-dym the company of the ring stood silent beside the tomb of balin frodo thought of bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf and of balins visit to the shire long ago in that UNK chamber in the mountains it seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world at length they stirred and looked up and began to search for anything that would give them tidings of balins fate or show what had become of his folk there was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber under the shaft by both the doors they could now see that many bones were lying and among them were broken swords and UNK and cloven UNK and UNK some of the swords were crooked UNK with UNK blades there were many UNK cut in the rock of the walls and in them were large UNK UNK of wood all had been broken and UNK but beside the UNK lid of one there lay the remains of a book it had been UNK and UNK and partly burned and it was so stained with black and other dark marks like old blood that little of it could be read gandalf lifted it carefully but the leaves UNK and broke as he laid it on the UNK he UNK over it for some time without speaking frodo and gimli standing at his side could see as he UNK turned the leaves that they were written by many different hands in runes both of moria and of dale and here and there in elvish script at last gandalf looked up it seems to be a record of the UNK of balins folk he said v i guess that it began with their coming to dimrill dale nigh on thirty years ago the pages seem to have numbers UNK to the years after their arrival the top page is marked one  three so at least two are missing from the beginning listen to this we drove out ores from the great gate and guard  i think the next word is blurred and burned probably room  we slew many in the bright  i think  sun in the dale UNK was killed by an arrow he slew the great then there is a UNK followed by UNK under grass near mirror mere the next line or two i cannot read then comes we have taken the UNK hall of north end to dwell in there is i cannot read what a shaft is mentioned then balin has set up his seat in the chamber of mazarbul the chamber of records said gimli v i guess that is where we now stand well i can read no more for a long way said gandalf except the word gold  and UNK s axe and something helm then balin is now lord of UNK that seems to end a chapter after some stars another hand begins and i can see we found UNK and later the word UNK and then something i have it mithril and the last two lines uin to seek for the upper UNK of third deep something go westwards a UNK to hollin gate gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside there are several pages of the same sort rather hastily written and much UNK he said but i can make little of them in this light now there must be a number of leaves missing because they begin to be UNK five the fifth year of the UNK i suppose let me see no they are too cut and stained i cannot read them we might do better in the sunlight wait here is something a large bold hand using an elvish script that would be UNK hand said gimli looking over the wizards arm he could write well and UNK and often used the elvish UNK i fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair hand said gandalf the first clear word is sorrow but the rest of the line is lost unless it ends in UNK yes it must be UNK followed by day being the UNK of UNK balin lord of moria fell in dimrill dale he went alone to look in mirror mere an ore shot him from behind a stone we slew the ore UNK many more up from east up the silverlode the remainder of the page is so blurred that i can hardly make anything out but i think i can read we have barred the gates and then can hold them long if and then perhaps horrible and suffer poor balin he seems to have kept the title that he took for less than five years i wonder what happened afterwards but there is no time to UNK out the last few pages here is the last page of all he paused and sighed it is grim reading he said i fear their end was cruel listen we cannot get out we cannot get out they have taken the bridge and second hall UNK and UNK and UNK fell there then there are four lines UNK so that i can only read went  days ago the last lines run the pool is up to the wall at UNK the UNK in the water took uin we cannot get out the end comes and then drums drums in the deep i wonder what that means the last thing written is in a UNK UNK of UNK they are coming there is nothing more gandalf paused and stood in silent thought a sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the company  we cannot get out muttered gimli it was well for us that the pool had sunk a little and that the UNK was sleeping down at the southern end gandalf raised his head and looked round they seem to have made a last stand by both doors he said but there were not many left by that time so ended the attempt to UNK moria it was valiant but foolish the time is not come yet now i fear we must say farewell to balin son of UNK here he must lie in the halls of his fathers we will take this book the book of mazarbul and look at it more closely later you had better keep it gimli and take it back to dbin if you get a chance it will interest him though it will UNK him deeply come let us go the morning is passing which way shall we go  asked boromir back to the hall answered gandalf but our visit to this room has not been in vain i now know where we are this must be as gimli says the chamber of mazarbul and the hall must be the UNK of the UNK therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the hall and bear right and south and go downwards the UNK hall should be on the UNK level that is six above the level of the gates come now back to the hall f gandalf had hardly spoken these words when there came a great noise a rolling UNK that seemed to come from depths far below and to tremble in the stone at their feet they sprang towards the door in alarm doom doom it rolled again as if huge hands were turning the very UNK of moria into a vast UNK then there came an echoing UNK a great horn was blown in the hall and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off there was a hurrying sound of many feet they are coming  cried legolas we cannot get out said gimli trapped  cried gandalf why did i delay here we are caught just as they were before but i was not here then we will see what   doom doom came the UNK and the walls shook UNK the doors and UNK them  shouted aragorn and keep your packs on as long as you can we may get a chance to cut our way out yet no  said gandalf we must not get shut in keep the east door UNK we will go that way if we get a chance another harsh UNK and shrill cries rang out feet were coming down the corridor there was a ring and UNK as the company drew their swords glamdring shone with a pale light and sting glinted at the edges boromir set his shoulder against the western door wait a moment do not close it yet  said gandalf he sprang forward to boromirs side and drew himself up to his full height who comes hither to UNK the rest of balin lord of moria  he cried in a loud voice there was a rush of hoarse laughter like the fall of UNK stones into a pit amid the UNK a deep voice was raised in command doom UNK doom went the drums in the deep with a quick movement gandalf stepped before the narrow opening of the door and thrust forward his staff there was a UNK flash that lit the chamber and the passage outside for an instant the wizard looked out arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back there are ores very many of them he said and some are large and evil black UNK of mordor for the moment they are hanging back but there is something else there a great UNK i think or more than one there is no hope of escape that way and no hope at all if they come at the other door as well said boromir there is no sound outside here yet said aragorn who was standing by the eastern door listening the passage on this side UNK straight down a stair it plainly does not lead back towards the hall but it is no good flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind we cannot UNK the door its key is gone and the lock is broken and it opens inwards we must do something to delay the enemy first we will make them fear the chamber of mazarbul he said grimly feeling the edge of his sword andril heavy feet were heard in the corridor boromir flung himself against the door and UNK it to then he UNK it with broken UNK and UNK of wood the company retreated to the other side of the chamber but they had no chance to fly yet there was a blow on the door that made it quiver and then it began to UNK slowly open driving back the UNK a huge arm and shoulder with a dark skin of UNK UNK was thrust through the widening gap then a great flat UNK foot was forced through below there was a dead silence outside boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might but his sword rang glanced aside and fell from his shaken hand the blade was UNK suddenly and to his own surprise frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in his heart the shire  he cried and springing beside boromir he stooped and UNK with sting at the hideous foot there was a UNK and the foot UNK back nearly UNK sting from frodos arm black UNK UNK from the blade and UNK on the floor boromir hurled himself against the door and UNK it again one for the shire  cried aragorn the hobbits bite is deep you have a good blade frodo son of drogo   there was a crash on the door followed by crash after crash UNK and UNK were beating against it it cracked and staggered back and the opening grew suddenly wide arrows came whistling in but struck the northern wall and fell UNK to the floor there was a UNK and a rush of feet and ores one after another leaped into the chamber how many there were the company could not count the UNK was sharp but the ores were dismayed by the UNK of the defence legolas shot two through the throat gimli hewed the legs from under another that had UNK up on balin s tomb boromir and aragorn slew many when UNK had fallen the rest fled UNK leaving the UNK UNK except for sam who had a UNK along the UNK a quick UNK had saved him and he had UNK his ore a sturdy thrust with his UNK a fire was UNK in his brown eyes that would have made ted sandyman step backwards if he had seen it now is the time  cried gandalf let us go before the troll UNK but even as they retreated and before pippin and merry had reached the stair outside a huge UNK almost UNK clad in black mail from head to foot leaped into the chamber behind him his UNK UNK in the doorway his broad flat face was UNK his eyes were like UNK and his tongue was red he UNK a great spear with a thrust of his huge hide shield he turned boromirs sword and bore him backwards throwing him to the ground UNK under aragorns blow with the speed of a UNK UNK he UNK into the company and thrust with his spear straight at frodo the blow caught him on the right side and frodo was hurled against the wall and UNK sam with a cry UNK at the UNK shaft and it broke but even as the ore flung down the UNK and swept out his UNK andril came down upon his helm there was a flash like flame and the helm burst UNK the ore fell with cloven head his UNK fled howling as boromir and aragorn sprang at them doom doom went the drums in the deep the great voice rolled out again now  shouted gandalf now is the last chance run for it  aragorn picked up frodo where he lay by the wall and made for the stair pushing merry and pippin in front of him the others followed but gimli had to be dragged away by legolas in spite of the peril he lingered by balins tomb with his head bowed boromir UNK the eastern door to UNK upon its UNK it had great iron rings on either side but could not be fastened i am all right gasped frodo i can walk put me down  aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement i thought you were dead  he cried not yet  said gandalf but there is time for wonder off you go all of you down the stairs wait a few minutes for me at the bottom but if i do not come soon go on go quickly and choose paths leading right and downwards we cannot leave you to hold the door alone  said aragorn do as i say  said gandalf fiercely swords are no more use here go the passage was lit by no shaft and was UNK dark they groped their way down a long flight of steps and then looked back but they could see nothing except high above them the faint glimmer of the wizards staff he seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door frodo breathed heavily and leaned against sam who put his arms about him they stood peering up the stairs into the darkness frodo thought he could hear the voice of gandalf above muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo he could not catch what was said the walls seemed to be trembling every now and again the drum-beats UNK and rolled doom doom suddenly at the top of the stair there was a UNK of white light then there was a dull UNK and a heavy UNK the drum-beats broke out wildly UNK UNK and then stopped gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the company well well thats over  said the wizard struggling to his feet i have done all that i could but i have met my match and have nearly been destroyed but dont stand here go on you will have to do without light for a while i am rather shaken go on go on where are you gimli come ahead with me keep close behind all of you they stumbled after him wondering what had happened doom doom went the drum-beats again they now sounded muffled and far away but they were following there was no other sound of pursuit neither UNK of feet nor any voice gandalf took no turns right or left for the passage seemed to be going in the direction that he desired every now and again it descended a flight of steps fifty or more to a lower level at the moment that was their chief danger for in the dark they could not see a UNK until they came on it and put their feet out into emptiness gandalf felt the ground with his staff like a blind man at the end of an hour they had gone a mile or maybe a little more and had descended many UNK of stairs there was still no sound of pursuit almost they began to hope that they would escape at the bottom of the UNK flight gandalf halted it is getting hot  he gasped we ought to be down at least to the level of the gates now soon i think we should look for a UNK turn to take us east i hope it is not far i am very weary i must rest here a moment even if all the ores ever UNK are after us gimli took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step what happened away up there at the door  he asked did you meet the UNK of the drums  i do not know answered gandalf but i found myself suddenly faced by something that i have not met before i could think of nothing to do but to try and put a UNK UNK on the door i know many but to do things of that kind rightly UNK time and even then the door can be broken by strength as i stood there i could hear UNK voices on the other side at any moment i thought they would burst it open i could not hear what was said they seemed to be talking in their own hideous language all i caught was UNK that is fire then something came into the chamber  i felt it through the door and the ores themselves were afraid and fell silent it laid hold of the iron ring and then it perceived me and my spell what it was i cannot guess but i have never felt such a challenge the UNK was terrible it nearly broke me for an instant the door left my UNK and began to open  i had to speak a word of command that proved too great a UNK the door burst in pieces something dark as a cloud was UNK out all the light inside and i was thrown backwards down the stairs all the wall gave way and the roof of the chamber as well i think i am afraid balin is buried deep and maybe something else is buried there too i cannot say but at least the passage behind us was UNK blocked ah i have never felt so spent but it is passing and now what about you frodo there was not time to say so but i have never been more delighted in my life than when you spoke i feared that it was a brave but dead hobbit that aragorn was carrying what about me  said frodo i am alive and whole i think i am UNK and in pain but it is not too bad well said aragorn i can only say that hobbits are made of a stuff so tough that i have never met the like of it had i known i would have spoken UNK in the inn at bree that spear UNK would have UNK a wild UNK  well it did not UNK me i am glad to say said frodo though i feel as if i had been caught between a hammer and an anvil he said no more he found breathing painful you take after bilbo said gandalf there is more about you than UNK the eye as i said of him long ago frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said they now went on again before long gimli spoke he had keen eyes in the dark i think he said that there is a light ahead but it is not daylight it is red what can it be   UNK  muttered gandalf i wonder if that is what they meant that the lower UNK are on fire still we can only go on soon the light became UNK and could be seen by all it was UNK and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them they could now see their way in front the road UNK down swiftly and some way ahead there stood a low archway through it the glowing light came the air became very hot when they came to the arch gandalf went through UNK to them to wait as he stood just beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red glow quickly he stepped back there is some new UNK here he said UNK for our welcome no doubt but i know now where we are we have reached the first deep the level immediately below the gates this is the second hall of old moria and the gates are near away beyond the eastern end on the left not more than a UNK of a mile across the bridge up a broad stair along a wide road through the first hall and out but come and look  they peered out before them was another cavernous hall it was UNK and far longer than the one in which they had slept they were near its eastern end westward it ran away into darkness down the centre UNK a double line of towering pillars they were carved like UNK of mighty trees whose boughs UNK the roof with a branching UNK of stone their stems were smooth and black but a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides right across the floor close to the feet of two huge pillars a great UNK had opened out of it a fierce red light came and now and again flames UNK at the brink and curled about the UNK of the UNK wisps of dark smoke UNK in the hot air if we had come by the main road down from the upper halls we should have been trapped here said gandalf let us hope that the fire now lies between us and pursuit come there is no time to lose even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing UNK doom doom doom away beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came cries and UNK doom doom  the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiver now for the last race  said gandalf if the sun is shining outside we may still escape after me  he turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall the distance was greater than it had looked as they ran they heard the beat and echo of many hurrying feet behind a shrill yell went up they had been seen there was a ring and UNK of steel an arrow whistled over frodos head boromir laughed they did not expect this he said the fire has cut them off we are on the wrong side  look ahead  called gandalf the bridge is near it is dangerous and narrow suddenly frodo saw before him a black chasm at the end of the hall the floor vanished and fell to an unknown UNK the outer door could only be reached by a slender bridge of stone without UNK or UNK that UNK the chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet it was an ancient defence of the dwarves against any enemy that might UNK the first hall and the outer passages they could only pass across it in single file at the brink gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind lead the way gimli  he said pippin and merry next straight on and up the stair beyond the door  arrows fell among them one struck frodo and sprang back another pierced gandalf s hat and stuck there like a black feather frodo looked behind beyond the fire he saw UNK black figures there seemed to be hundreds of ores they UNK UNK and UNK which shone red as blood in the firelight doom doom rolled the drum-beats growing louder and louder doom doom legolas turned and set an arrow to the string though it was a long shot for his small bow he drew but his hand fell and the arrow slipped to the ground he gave a cry of dismay and fear two great trolls appeared they bore great UNK of stone and flung them down to serve as UNK over the fire but it was not the trolls that had filled the elf with terror the UNK of the ores had opened and they crowded away as if they themselves were afraid something was coming up behind them what it was could not be seen it was like a great shadow in the middle of which was a dark form of UNK maybe yet greater and a power and terror seemed to be in it and to go before it it came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had bent over it then with a rush it leaped across the UNK the flames roared up to greet it and UNK about it and a black smoke swirled in the air its streaming UNK kindled and UNK behind it in its right hand was a blade like a UNK tongue of fire in its left it held a whip of many UNK ai ai  UNK legolas a balrog a balrog is come  gimli stared with wide eyes durins bane  he cried and letting his axe fall he covered his face a balrog muttered gandalf now i understand he UNK and leaned heavily on his staff what an evil fortune and i am already weary the dark figure streaming with fire UNK towards them the ores UNK and UNK over the stone UNK then boromir raised his horn and blew loud the challenge rang and UNK like the shout of many UNK under the cavernous roof for a moment the ores UNK and the fiery shadow halted then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark wind and the enemy advanced again over the bridge cried gandalf UNK his strength fly  this is a UNK beyond any of you i must hold the narrow way fly  aragorn and boromir did not heed the command but still held their ground side by side behind gandalf at the far end of the bridge the others halted just within the doorway at the halls end and turned unable to leave their leader to face the enemy alone the balrog reached the bridge gandalf stood in the middle of the UNK leaning on the staff in his left hand but in his other hand glamdring gleamed cold and white his enemy halted again facing him and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings it raised the whip and the UNK whined and cracked fire came from its UNK but gandalf stood firm you cannot pass he said the ores stood still and a dead silence fell v i am a servant of the secret fire UNK of the flame of anor you cannot pass the dark fire will not avail you flame of UNK go back to the shadow you cannot pass the balrog made no answer the fire in it seemed to die but the darkness grew it stepped forward slowly on to the bridge and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height and its wings were spread from wall to wall but still gandalf could be seen glimmering in the gloom he seemed small and altogether alone grey and bent like a UNK tree before the UNK of a storm from out of the shadow a red sword leaped UNK glamdring glittered white in answer there was a ringing UNK and a UNK of white fire the balrog fell back and its sword flew up in UNK UNK the wizard swayed on the bridge stepped back a pace and then again stood still you cannot pass  he said with a bound the balrog leaped full upon the bridge its whip UNK and hissed he cannot stand alone  cried aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge elendil he shouted i am with you gandalf  gondor  cried boromir and leaped after him at that moment gandalf lifted his staff and crying aloud he smote the bridge before him the staff broke UNK and fell from his hand a blinding UNK of white flame sprang up the bridge cracked right at the UNK feet it broke and the stone upon which it stood UNK into the UNK while the rest remained UNK quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness with a terrible cry the balrog fell forward and its shadow plunged down and vanished but even as it fell it swung its whip and the UNK UNK and curled about the wizards knees UNK him to the brink he staggered and fell UNK UNK at the stone and UNK into the UNK fly you UNK  he cried and was gone the UNK went out and blank darkness fell the company stood rooted with horror staring into the pit even as aragorn and boromir came flying back the rest of the bridge cracked and fell with a cry aragorn roused them come i will lead you now   he called we must UNK his last command follow me  they stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door aragorn leading boromir at the rear at the top was a wide echoing passage along this they fled frodo heard sam at his side weeping and then he found that he himself was weeping as he ran doom doom doom the drum-beats rolled behind UNK now and slow doom they ran on the light grew before them great shafts pierced the roof they ran UNK they passed into a hall bright with daylight from its high windows in the east they fled across it through its huge broken doors they passed and suddenly before them the great gates opened an arch of blazing light there was a guard of ores crouching in the shadows behind the great door UNK towering on either side but the gates were UNK and cast down aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in his path and the rest fled in terror of his wrath the company swept past them and took no heed of them out of the gates they ran and sprang down the huge and UNK steps the threshold of moria thus at last they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on their faces they did not halt until they were out of UNK from the walls dimrill dale lay about them the shadow of the misty mountains lay upon it but eastwards there was a golden light on the land it was but one hour after noon the sun was shining the clouds were white and high they looked back dark yawned the archway of the gates under the UNK faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats doom a thin black smoke trailed out nothing else was to be seen the dale all around was empty doom grief at last wholly overcame them and they wept long some standing and silent some cast upon the ground doom doom the drum-beats faded chapter   lothlurien alas i fear we cannot stay here longer said aragorn he looked towards the mountains and held up his sword farewell gandalf   he cried did i not say to you if you pass the doors of moria UNK alas that i spoke true what hope have we without you  he turned to the company we must do without hope he said at least we may yet be UNK let us UNK ourselves and UNK no more come we have a long road and much to do they rose and looked about them northward the dale ran up into a glen of shadows between two great arms of the mountains above which three white peaks were shining UNK UNK caradhras the mountains of moria at the head of the glen a UNK flowed like a white UNK over an endless ladder of short falls and a mist of foam hung in the air about the mountains feet yonder is the dimrill stair said aragorn pointing to the falls down the UNK way that UNK beside the UNK we should have come if fortune had been UNK or caradhras less cruel said gimli there he stands smiling in the sun  he shook his UNK at the UNK of the UNK peaks and turned away to the east the UNK arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end and far lands could be UNK beyond them wide and vague to the south the misty mountains UNK endlessly as far as sight could reach less than a mile away and a little below them for they still stood high up on the west side of the dale there lay a mere it was long and UNK shaped like a great UNK thrust deep into the northern glen but its southern end was beyond the shadows under the sunlit sky yet its waters were dark a deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a UNK room its face was still and UNK about it lay a smooth UNK UNK down on all sides to its bare unbroken rim there lies the mirrormere deep kheled-zvram  said gimli sadly i remember that he said may you have joy of the sight but we cannot UNK there now long shall i journey ere i have joy again it is i that must UNK away and he that must remain the company now went down the road from the gates it was rough and broken fading to a winding track between heather and UNK that thrust amid the UNK stones but still it could be seen that once long ago a great paved way had wound upwards from the UNK of the UNK in places there were ruined works of stone beside the path and mounds of green UNK with slender UNK or UNK sighing in the wind an eastward bend led them hard by the UNK of mirrormere and there not far from the UNK stood a single UNK broken at the top that is durins stone  cried gimli i cannot pass without turning aside for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale   be swift then  said aragorn looking back towards the gates the sun UNK early the ores will not maybe come out till after dusk but we must be far away before nightfall the moon is almost spent and it will be dark tonight come with me frodo  cried the dwarf springing from the road i would not have you go without seeing kheled-zvram he ran down the long green slope frodo followed slowly drawn by the still blue water in spite of hurt and weariness sam came up behind beside the standing stone gimli halted and looked up it was cracked and UNK and the faint runes upon its side could not be read this pillar marks the spot where durin first looked in the mirrormere said the dwarf let us look ourselves once ere we go they stooped over the dark water at first they could see nothing then slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a UNK blue and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them beyond there was a space of sky there like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars though sunlight was in the sky above of their own stooping forms no shadow could be seen o kheled-zvram fair and wonderful  said gimli there lies the crown of durin till he UNK farewell  he bowed and turned away and hastened back up the UNK to the road again what did you see  said pippin to sam but sam was too deep in thought to answer the road now turned south and went quickly downwards running out from between the arms of the dale some way below the mere they came on a deep well of water clear as crystal from which a UNK fell over a stone lip and ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channel here is the spring from which the silverlode rises said gimli do not drink of it it is icy cold soon it becomes a swift river and it UNK water from many other UNK streams said aragorn our road UNK beside it for many miles for i shall take you by the road that gandalf chose and first i hope to come to the woods where the silverlode flows into the great UNK yonder they looked as he pointed and before them they could see the stream leaping down to the UNK of the valley and then running on and away into the lower lands until it was lost in a golden haze there lie the woods of lothlurien  said legolas that is the fairest of all the dwellings of my people there are no trees like the trees of that land for in the autumn their leaves fall not but turn to gold not till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall and then the boughs are laden with yellow flowers and the floor of the wood is golden and golden is the roof and its pillars are of silver for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey so still our songs in mirkwood say my heart would be glad if i were beneath the eaves of that wood and it were UNK   my heart will be glad even in the winter said aragorn but it lies many miles away let us UNK  for some time frodo and sam managed to keep up with the others but aragorn was leading them at a great pace and after a while they UNK behind they had eaten nothing since the early morning sams cut was burning like fire and his head felt light in spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of moria he shivered frodo felt every step more painful and he gasped for breath at last legolas turned and seeing them now far behind he spoke to aragorn the others halted and aragorn ran back calling to boromir to come with him i am sorry frodo  he cried full of concern so much has happened this day and we have such need of haste that i have forgotten that you were hurt and sam too you should have spoken we have done nothing to ease you as we ought though all the ores of moria were after us come now a little further on there is a place where we can rest for a little there i will do what i can for you come boromir we will carry them soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from the west and joined its bubbling water with the hurrying silverlode together they plunged over a fall of UNK stone and UNK down into a dell about it stood UNK short and bent and its sides were steep and clothed with UNK and UNK of UNK UNK at the bottom there was a level space through which the stream flowed UNK over shining UNK here they rested it was now nearly three hours after noon and they had come only a few miles from the gates already the sun was westering while gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of UNK and UNK and drew water aragorn tended sam and frodo sams wound was not deep but it looked UNK and aragorns face was grave as he UNK it after a moment he looked up with relief good luck sam  he said many have received worse than this in UNK for the UNK of their first ore the cut is not UNK as the UNK of UNK too often are it should heal well when i have tended it bathe it when gimli has UNK water he opened his UNK and drew out some withered leaves they are dry and some of their virtue has one he said but here i have still some of the leaves of UNK that i gathered near weathertop UNK one in the water and UNK the wound clean and i will bind it now it is your turn frodo  i am all right said frodo reluctant to have his garments touched all i needed was some food and a little rest no  said aragorn we must have a look and see what the hammer and the anvil have done to you i still UNK that you are alive at all gently he UNK off frodos old jacket and worn UNK and gave a UNK of wonder then he laughed the silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like the light upon a rippling sea carefully he took it off and held it up and the gems on it glittered like stars and the sound of the shaken rings was like the UNK of rain in a pool look my friends he called heres a pretty UNK to UNK an UNK UNK UNK in if it were known that hobbits had such UNK all the hunters of middle-earth would be riding to the shire and all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain said gimli gazing at the mail in wonder it is a UNK mithril i have never seen or heard tell of one so fair is this the coat that gandalf spoke of then he UNK it but it was well given  i have often wondered what you and bilbo were doing so close in his little room said merry bless the old hobbit i love him more than ever i hope we get a chance of telling him about it  there was a dark and UNK UNK on frodos right side and breast under the mail there was a UNK of soft leather but at one point the rings had been driven through it into the UNK frodos left side also was scored and UNK where he had been hurled against the wall while the others set the food ready aragorn UNK the UNK with water in which UNK was UNK the UNK fragrance filled the dell and all those who stooped over the UNK water felt refreshed and UNK soon frodo felt the pain leave him and his breath grew easy though he was stiff and UNK to the touch for many days aragorn bound some soft UNK of cloth at his side the mail is UNK light he said put it on again if you can bear it my heart is glad to know that you have such a coat do not lay it aside even in sleep unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a while and that will seldom chance while your quest lasts when they had eaten the company got ready to go on they put out the fire and hid all UNK of it then climbing out of the dell they took to the road again they had not gone far before the sun sank behind the westward heights and great shadows crept down the UNK dusk veiled their feet and mist rose in the hollows away in the east the evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood sam and frodo now feeling UNK and greatly refreshed were able to go at a fair pace and with only one brief halt aragorn led the company on for nearly three more hours it was dark deep night had fallen there were many clear stars UNK the UNK waning moon would not be seen till late gimli and frodo were at the rear walking softly and not speaking listening for any sound upon the road behind at length gimli broke the silence not a sound but the wind he said there are no UNK near or my ears are made of wood it is to be hoped that the ores will be content with driving us from moria and maybe that was all their purpose and they had nothing else to do with UNK the ring though ores will often UNK foes for many leagues into the plain if they have a fallen captain to UNK frodo did not answer he looked at sting and the blade was dull yet he had heard something or thought he had as soon as the shadows had fallen about them and the road behind was dim he had heard again the quick UNK of feet even now he heard it he turned swiftly there were two UNK UNK of light behind or for a moment he thought he saw them but at once they slipped aside and vanished what is it  said the dwarf i dont know answered frodo i thought i heard feet and i thought i saw a UNK eyes i have thought so often since we first entered moria gimli halted and stooped to the ground i hear nothing but the UNK of plant and stone he said come let us hurry the others are out of sight the UNK blew chill up the valley to meet them before them a wide grey shadow loomed and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like UNK in the breeze lothlurien  cried legolas lothlurien we have come to the eaves of the golden wood alas that it is winter  under the night the trees stood tall before them arched over the road and stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs in the dim light of the stars their stems were grey and their quivering leaves a hint of UNK gold lothlurien  said aragorn glad i am to hear again the wind in the trees we are still little more than five leagues from the gates but we can go no further here let us hope that the virtue of the elves will keep us tonight from the peril that comes behind if elves indeed still dwell here in the UNK world said gimli it is long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land whence we wandered in ages long ago said legolas but we hear that lurien is not yet deserted for there is a secret power here that holds evil from the land UNK its folk are seldom seen and maybe they dwell now deep in the woods and far from the northern border indeed deep in the wood they dwell said aragorn and sighed as if some memory stirred in him we must UNK for ourselves tonight we will go forward a short way until the trees are all about us and then we will turn aside from the path and seek a place to rest in he stepped forward but boromir stood UNK and did not follow is there no other way  he said what other fairer way would you desire  said aragorn a plain road though it led through a hedge of swords said boromir by strange paths has this company been led and so far to evil fortune against my will we passed under the shades of moria to our loss and now we must enter the golden wood you say but of that perilous land we have heard in gondor and it is said that few come out who once go in and of that few none have escaped UNK say not UNK but if you say UNK then maybe you will speak the truth said aragorn but lore UNK in gondor boromir if in the city of those who once were wise they now speak evil of lothlurien believe what you will there is no other way for us  unless you would go back to UNK or UNK the pathless mountains or swim the great river all alone then lead on  said boromir but it is perilous perilous indeed said aragorn fair and perilous but only evil need fear it or those who bring some evil with them follow me  they had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came upon another stream flowing down swiftly from the UNK slopes that climbed back westward towards the mountains they heard it UNK over a fall away among the shadows on their right its dark hurrying waters ran across the path before them and joined the silverlode in a UNK of dim pools among the roots of trees here is nimrodel  said legolas of this stream the UNK elves made many songs long ago and still we sing them in the north remembering the UNK on its falls and the golden flowers that floated in its foam all is dark now and the bridge of nimrodel is broken down i will bathe my feet for it is said that the water is healing to the weary he went forward and climbed down the UNK bank and stepped into the stream follow me he cried the water is not deep let us UNK across on the further bank we can rest and the sound of the falling water may bring us sleep and UNK of grief one by one they climbed down and followed legolas for a moment frodo stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet it was cold but its touch was clean and as he went on and it mounted to his knees he felt that the UNK of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs when all the company had crossed they sat and rested and ate a little food and legolas told them tales of lothlurien that the elves of mirkwood still kept in their hearts of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by the great river before the world was grey at length a silence fell and they heard the music of the UNK running UNK in the shadows almost frodo UNK that he could hear a voice singing mingled with the sound of the water do you hear the voice of nimrodel  asked legolas i will sing you a song of the UNK nimrodel who bore the same name as the stream beside which she lived UNK ago it is a fair song in our woodland tongue but this is how it runs in the UNK speech as some in rivendell now sing it in a soft voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them he began an UNK there was of old a shining star by day her UNK white was UNK with gold her shoes of UNK a star was bound upon her brows a light was on her hair as sun upon the golden boughs in lurien the fair her hair was long her limbs were white and fair she was and free and in the wind she went as light as leaf of UNK beside the falls of nimrodel by water clear and cool her voice as falling silver fell into the shining pool where now she UNK none can tell in sunlight or in shade for lost of UNK was nimrodel and in the mountains strayed the UNK in UNK grey beneath the UNK UNK her for many a day beside the roaring sea a wind by night in northern lands arose and loud it cried and drove the ship from UNK across the streaming UNK when dawn came dim the land was lost the mountains sinking grey beyond the UNK waves that tossed their plumes of blinding UNK amroth beheld the fading shore now low beyond the UNK and cursed the UNK ship that bore him far from nimrodel of old he was an UNK a lord of tree and glen when golden were the boughs in spring in fair lothlurien from helm to sea they saw him leap as arrow from the string and UNK into the water deep as UNK upon the UNK the wind was in his flowing hair the foam about him shone afar they saw him strong and fair go riding like a swan but from the west has come no word and on the hither shore no tidings elven-folk have heard of amroth UNK the voice of legolas UNK and the song ceased i cannot sing any more he said that is but a part for i have forgotten much it is long and sad for it tells how sorrow came upon lothlurien lurien of the UNK when the dwarves awakened evil in the mountains but the dwarves did not make the evil said gimli i said not so yet evil came answered legolas sadly then many of the elves of UNK kindred left their dwellings and departed and she was lost far in the south in the passes of the white mountains and she came not to the ship where amroth her UNK waited for her but in the spring when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be heard by the falls that bear her name and when the wind is in the south the voice of amroth comes up from the sea for nimrodel flows into silverlode that elves call celebrant and celebrant into anduin the great and anduin flows into the bay of UNK elf alas whence the elves of lurien set sail but neither nimrodel nor amroth ever came back it is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that grew near the falls for that was the custom of the elves of lurien to dwell in the trees and maybe it is so still therefore they were called the galadhrim the tree UNK deep in their forest the trees are very great the people of the woods did not UNK in the ground like dwarves nor build strong places of stone before the shadow came and even in these latter days dwelling in the trees might be thought UNK than sitting on the ground said gimli he looked across the stream to the road that led back to dimrill dale and then up into the roof of dark boughs above your words bring good counsel gimli said aragorn we cannot build a house but tonight we will do as the galadhrim and seek refuge in the tree-tops if we can we have sat here beside the road already longer than was wise the company now turned aside from the path and went into the shadow of the deeper woods westward along the UNK away from silverlode not far from the falls of nimrodel they found a UNK of trees some of which overhung the stream their great grey trunks were of mighty UNK but their height could not be guessed i will climb up said legolas i am at home among trees by root or bough though these trees are of a kind strange to me save as a name in song UNK they are called and are those that bear the yellow UNK but i have never climbed in one i will see now what is their shape and way of UNK whatever it may be said pippin they will be marvellous trees indeed if they can offer any rest at night except to birds i cannot sleep on a perch   then dig a hole in the ground said legolas if that is more after the fashion of your kind but you must dig swift and deep if you wish to hide from ores he sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a branch that grew from the trunk high above his head but even as he swung there for a moment a voice spoke suddenly from the UNK above him  UNK  it said in commanding tone and legolas dropped back to earth in surprise and fear he shrank against the bole of the tree stand still  he whispered to the others do not move or speak  there was a sound of soft laughter over their heads and then another clear voice spoke in an elven-tongue frodo could understand little of what was said for the speech that the UNK folk east of the mountains used among themselves was UNK that of the west legolas looked up and answered in the same language  who are they and what do they say  asked merry theyre elves said sam cant you hear their voices  yes they are elves said legolas and they say that you breathe so loud that they could shoot you in the dark sam hastily put his hand over his mouth but they say also that you need have no fear they have been aware of us for a long while they heard my voice across the nimrodel and knew that i was one of their northern kindred and therefore they did not hinder our crossing and afterwards they heard my song now they bid me climb up with frodo for they seem to have had some tidings of him and of our journey the others they ask to wait a little and to keep watch at the foot of the tree until they have decided what is to be done out of the shadows a ladder was let down it was made of rope UNK and glimmering in the dark and though it looked slender it proved strong enough to bear many men legolas ran lightly up and frodo followed slowly behind came sam trying not to breathe loudly the branches of the UNK grew out nearly straight from the trunk and then swept UNK but near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs and among these they found that there had been built a wooden UNK or flet as such things were called in those days the elves called it a UNK it was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder passed when frodo came at last up on to the flet he found legolas seated with three other elves they were clad in UNK and could not be seen among the UNK unless they moved suddenly they stood up and one of them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver UNK he held it up looking at frodos face and sams then he shut off the light again and spoke words of welcome in his elven-tongue frodo spoke UNK in return welcome the elf then said again in the common UNK speaking slowly we seldom use any tongue but our own for we dwell now in the heart of the forest and do not willingly have dealings with any other folk even our own kindred in the north are UNK from us but there are some of us still who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our enemies and they speak the languages of other lands i am one haldir is my name my UNK UNK and UNK speak little of your tongue but we have heard rumours of your coming for the messengers of elrond passed by UNK on their way home up the dimrill stair we had not heard of hobbits or halflings for many a long year and did not know that any yet dwelt in middle-earth you do not look evil and since you come with an elf of our kindred we are willing to UNK you as elrond asked though it is not our custom to lead strangers through our land but you must stay here tonight how many are you  eight said legolas myself four hobbits and two men one of whom aragorn is an elf-friend of the folk of westernesse the name of aragorn son of arathorn is known in lurien said haldir and he has the UNK of the lady all then is well but you have yet spoken only of seven the UNK is a dwarf said legolas a dwarf  said haldir that is not well we have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days they are not permitted in our land i cannot allow him to pass but he is from the lonely mountain one of UNK UNK people and friendly to elrond said frodo elrond himself chose him to be one of our companions and he has been brave and faithful the elves spoke together in soft voices and questioned legolas in their own tongue very good said haldir at last we will do this though it is against our liking if aragorn and legolas will guard him and answer for him he shall pass but he must go blindfold through lothlurien but now we must debate no longer your folk must not remain on the ground we have been keeping watch on the rivers ever since we saw a great UNK of ores going north toward moria along the skirts of the mountains many days ago wolves are howling on the woods borders if you have indeed come from moria the peril cannot be far behind tomorrow early you must go on the four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with UNK we do not fear them there is another UNK UNK in the next tree there the others must take refuge you legolas must answer to us for them call us if anything is amiss and have an eye on that dwarf legolas at once went down the ladder to take UNK message and soon afterwards merry and pippin clambered up on to the high flet they were out of breath and seemed rather scared there said merry UNK we have UNK up your blankets as well as our own strider has hidden all the rest of the baggage in a deep drift of leaves you had no need of your burdens said haldir it is cold in the tree-tops in winter though the wind tonight is in the south but we have food and drink to give you that will drive away the UNK and we have UNK and cloaks to spare the hobbits accepted this second and far better supper very gladly then they wrapped themselves UNK not only in the UNK of the elves but in their own blankets as well and tried to go to sleep but weary as they were only sam found that easy to do hobbits do not like heights and do not sleep UNK even when they have any stairs the flet was not at all to their liking as a UNK it had no walls not even a UNK only on one side was there a light UNK UNK which could be moved and fixed in different places according to the wind pippin went on talking for a while i hope if i do go to sleep in this UNK that i shant roll off he said once i do get to sleep said sam i shall go on sleeping whether i roll off or no and the less said the sooner ill drop off if you take my meaning frodo lay for some time awake and looked up at the stars glinting through the pale roof of quivering leaves sam was UNK at his side long before he himself closed his eyes he could dimly see the grey forms of two elves sitting UNK with their arms about their knees speaking in whispers the other had gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower branches at last UNK by the wind in the boughs above and the sweet murmur of the falls of nimrodel below frodo fell asleep with the song of legolas running in his mind late in the night he awoke the other hobbits were asleep the elves were gone the UNK moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves the wind was still a little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on the ground below there was a ring of metal the sounds died slowly away and seemed to go southward on into the wood a head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a UNK elf he looked towards the hobbits what is it  said frodo  UNK  said the elf in a hissing whisper and cast on to the flet the UNK rolled up ores  said frodo what are they doing  but the elf had gone there were no more sounds even the leaves were silent and the very falls seemed to be UNK frodo sat and shivered in his UNK he was UNK that they had not been caught on the ground but he felt that the trees offered little protection except UNK ores were as keen as UNK on a scent it was said but they could also climb he drew out sting it flashed and glittered like a blue flame and then slowly faded again and grew dull in spite of the fading of his sword the feeling of UNK danger did not leave frodo rather it grew stronger he got up and crawled to the opening and peered down he was almost certain that he could hear UNK movements at the trees foot far below not elves for the woodland folk were altogether UNK in their movements then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing and something seemed to be UNK on the bark of the UNK he stared down into the dark holding his breath something was now climbing slowly and its breath came like a soft hissing through closed teeth then coming up close to the stem frodo saw two pale eyes they stopped and gazed UNK UNK suddenly they turned away and a shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished immediately afterwards haldir came climbing swiftly up through the branches there was something in this tree that i have never seen before he said it was not an ore it fled as soon as i touched the tree UNK it seemed to be wary and to have some skill in trees or i might have thought that it was one of you hobbits i did not shoot for i dared not UNK any cries we cannot risk battle a strong company of ores has passed they crossed the UNK their foul feet in its clean water UNK went on down the old road beside the river they seemed to pick up some scent and they searched the ground for a while near the place where you halted the three of us could not challenge a hundred so we went ahead and spoke with UNK voices leading them on into the wood UNK has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people none of the ores will ever return out of lurien and there will be many elves hidden on the northern border before another night falls but you must take the road south as soon as it is fully light day came pale from the east as the light grew it UNK through the yellow leaves of the mallorn and it seemed to the hobbits that the early sun of a cool summers morning was shining UNK sky UNK among the moving branches looking through an opening on the south side of the flet frodo saw all the valley of the silverlode lying like a sea of UNK gold tossing gently in the breeze the morning was still young and cold when the company set out again guided now by haldir and his brother UNK farewell sweet nimrodel  cried legolas frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey UNK farewell he said it seemed to him that he would never hear again a running water so beautiful for ever UNK its UNK notes in an endless UNK music they went back to the path that still went on along the west side of the silverlode and for some way they followed it southward there were the UNK of UNK in the earth but soon haldir turned aside into the trees and halted on the bank of the river under their shadows there is one of my people yonder across the stream he said though you may not see him he gave a call like the low UNK of a bird and out of a thicket of young trees an elf stepped clad in grey but with his hood thrown back his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun haldir UNK cast over the stream a UNK of grey rope and he caught it and bound the end about a tree near the bank celebrant is already a strong stream here as you see said haldir and it runs both swift and deep and is very cold we do not set foot in it so far north unless we must but in these days of UNK we do not make bridges this is how we cross follow me he made his end of the rope fast about another tree and then ran lightly along it over the river and back again as if he were on a road v i can walk this path said legolas but the others have not this skill must they swim no said haldir we have two more ropes we will UNK them above the other one UNK and another UNK and holding these the strangers should be able to cross with care when this slender bridge had been made the company passed over some cautiously and slowly others more easily of the hobbits pippin proved the best for he was UNK and he walked over quickly holding only with one hand but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down sam UNK along clutching hard and looking down into the pale UNK water as if it was a chasm in the mountains he breathed with relief when he was safely across live and learn as my gaffer used to say though he was thinking of UNK not of UNK like a bird nor of trying to walk like a UNK not even my uncle UNK ever did a trick like that  when at length all the company was gathered on the east bank of the silverlode the elves UNK the ropes and UNK two of them UNK who had remained on the other side drew back the last one UNK it on his shoulder and with a wave of his hand went away back to nimrodel to keep watch now friends said haldir you have entered the naith of lurien or the UNK as you would say for it is the land that lies like a spear UNK between the arms of silverlode and anduin the great we allow no strangers to spy out the secrets of the naith few indeed are permitted even to set foot there as was agreed i shall here blindfold the eyes of gimli the dwarf the other may walk free for a while until we come nearer to our dwellings down in UNK in the UNK between the waters this was not at all to the liking of gimli the UNK was made without my UNK he said i will not walk blindfold like a UNK or a UNK and i am no spy my folk have never had dealings with any of the servants of the enemy neither have we done harm to the elves i am no more likely to UNK you than legolas or any other of my companions i do not doubt you said haldir yet this is our UNK i am not the master of the UNK and cannot set it aside i have done much in letting you set foot over celebrant gimli was UNK he planted his feet firmly apart and laid his hand upon the UNK of his axe i will go forward free he said or i will go back and seek my own land where i am known to be true of word though i UNK alone in the wilderness you cannot go back said haldir UNK now you have come thus far you must be brought before the lord and the lady they shall judge you to hold you or to give you leave as they will you cannot cross the rivers again and behind you there are now secret UNK that you cannot pass you would be slain before you saw them gimli drew his axe from his belt haldir and his companion bent their bows a plague on dwarves and their stiff necks  said legolas come said aragorn if i am still to lead this company you must do as i bid it is hard upon the dwarf to be thus UNK out we will all be blindfold even legolas that will be best though it will make the journey slow and dull gimli laughed suddenly a merry UNK of UNK we shall look will haldir lead us all on a string like many blind UNK with one dog but i will be content if only legolas here UNK my UNK i am an elf and a UNK here said legolas becoming angry in his turn now let us cry a plague on the stiff necks of elves said aragorn but the company shall all fare alike come bind our eyes haldir  i shall claim full UNK for every fall and UNK UNK if you do not lead us well said gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes you will have no claim said haldir i shall lead you well and the paths are smooth and straight alas for the folly of these days  said legolas here all are enemies of the one enemy and yet i must walk blind while the sun is merry in the woodland under leaves of gold  folly it may seem said haldir indeed in nothing is the power of the dark lord more clearly shown than in the UNK that UNK all those who still UNK him yet so little UNK and trust do we find now in the world beyond lothlurien unless maybe in rivendell that we dare not by our own trust UNK our land we live now upon an island amid many perils and our hands are more often upon the UNK than upon the UNK the rivers long UNK us but they are a sure guard no more for the shadow has crept northward all about us some speak of departing yet for that it already seems too late the mountains to the west are growing evil to the east the lands are waste and full of saurons creatures and it is UNK that we cannot now safely pass southward through rohan and the mouths of the great river are watched by the enemy even if we could come to the shores of the sea we should find no longer any shelter there it is said that there are still havens of the high elves but they are far north and west beyond the land of the halflings but where that may be though the lord and lady may know i do not you ought at least to guess since you have seen us said merry there are UNK west of my land the shire where hobbits live happy folk are hobbits to dwell near the shores of the sea  said haldir it is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it yet still we remember it in song tell me of these havens as we walk i cannot said merry i have never seen them i have never been out of my own land before and if i had known what the world outside was like i dont think i should have had the heart to leave it not even to see fair lothlurien  said haldir the world is indeed full of peril and in it there are many dark places but still there is much that is fair and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief it grows perhaps the greater some there are among us who sing that the shadow will draw back and peace shall come again yet i do not believe that the world about us will ever again be as it was of old or the light of the sun as it was UNK for the elves i fear it will prove at best a UNK in which they may pass to the sea UNK and leave the middle-earth for ever alas for lothlurien that i love it would be a poor life in a land where no mallorn grew but if there are mallorn-trees beyond the great sea none have reported it as they spoke thus the company UNK slowly along the paths in the wood led by haldir while the other elf walked behind they felt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft and after a while they walked more freely without fear of hurt or fall being UNK of sight frodo found his hearing and other senses UNK he could smell the trees and the trodden grass he could hear many different notes in the rustle of the leaves overhead the river UNK away on his right and the thin clear voices of birds in the sky he felt the sun upon his face and hands when they passed through an open glade as soon as he set foot upon the far bank of silverlode a strange feeling had come upon him and it deepened as he walked on into the naith it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of the elder days and was UNK walking in a world that was no more in rivendell there was memory of ancient things in lurien the ancient things still lived on in the waking world evil had been seen and heard there sorrow had been known the elves feared and UNK the world outside wolves were howling on the woods borders but on the land of lurien no shadow lay all that day the company marched on until they felt the cool evening come and heard the early UNK wind whispering among many leaves then they rested and slept without fear upon the ground for their UNK would not UNK them to UNK their eyes and they could not climb in the morning they went on again walking without haste at noon they halted and frodo was aware that they had passed out under the shining sun suddenly he heard the sound of many voices all around him a UNK host of elves had come up silently they were UNK toward the northern borders to guard against any attack from moria and they brought news some of which haldir reported the UNK ores had been UNK and almost all destroyed the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains and were being pursued a strange creature also had been seen running with bent back and with hands near the ground like a beast and yet UNK had UNK UNK and they had not shot it not knowing whether it was good or ill and it had vanished down the silverlode southward also said haldir they bring me a message from the lord and lady of the galadhrim you are all to walk free even the dwarf gimli it seems that the lady knows who and what is each member of your company new messages have come from rivendell perhaps he removed the UNK first from gimli s eyes your pardon  he said bowing low look on us now with friendly eyes look and be glad for you are the first dwarf to behold the trees of the naith of lurien since durins day  when his eyes were in turn uncovered frodo looked up and caught his breath they were standing in an open space to the left stood a great mound covered with a UNK of grass as green as UNK in the elder days upon it as a double crown grew two UNK of trees the outer had bark of UNK white and were UNK but beautiful in their UNK UNK the inner were mallorn-trees of great height still UNK in pale gold high amid the branches of a towering tree that stood in the centre of all there gleamed a white flet at the feet of the trees and all about the green UNK the grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars among them nodding on slender UNK were other flowers white and UNK green they UNK as a mist amid the rich hue of the grass over all the sky was blue and the sun of afternoon glowed upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees behold you are come to cerin amroth said haldir for this is the heart of the ancient realm as it was long ago and here is the mound of amroth where in happier days his high house was built here ever bloom the winter flowers in the UNK grass the yellow elanor and the pale UNK here we will stay UNK and come to the city of the galadhrim at dusk the others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass but frodo stood UNK still lost in wonder it seemed to him that he had stepped through a high window that looked on a vanished world a light was upon it for which his language had no name all that he saw was UNK but the shapes seemed at once clear cut as if they had been first UNK and drawn at the UNK of his eyes and ancient as if they had endured for ever he saw no colour but those he knew gold and white and blue and green but they were fresh and UNK as if he had at that moment first perceived them and made for them names new and wonderful in winter here no heart could UNK for summer or for spring no UNK or UNK or UNK could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth on the land of lurien there was no UNK he turned and saw that sam was now standing beside him looking round with a puzzled expression and UNK his eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake its sunlight and bright day right enough he said i thought that elves were all for moon and stars but this is more elvish than anything i ever heard tell of i feel as if i was inside a song if you take my meaning haldir looked at them and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both thought and word he smiled you feel the power of the lady of the galadhrim he said would it please you to climb with me up cerin amroth f they followed him as he stepped lightly up the UNK slopes though he walked and breathed and about him living leaves and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as UNK his face frodo felt that he was in a UNK land that did not fade or change or fall into UNK when he had gone and passed again into the outer world still frodo the UNK from the shire would walk there upon the grass among elanor and UNK in fair lothlurien they entered the circle of white trees as they did so the south wind blew upon cerin amroth and sighed among the branches frodo stood still hearing far off great seas upon UNK that had long ago been washed away and UNK crying whose race had perished from the earth haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet as frodo prepared to follow him he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder never before had he been so suddenly and so UNK aware of the feel and UNK of a trees skin and of the life within it he felt a delight in wood and the touch of it neither as UNK nor as UNK it was the delight of the living tree itself as he stepped out at last upon the lofty UNK haldir took his hand and turned him toward the south look this way first  he said frodo looked and saw still at some distance a hill of many mighty trees or a city of green towers which it was he could not tell out of it it seemed to him that the power and light came that held all the land in sway he longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city then he looked eastward and saw all the land of lurien running down to the pale gleam of anduin the great river he lifted his eyes across the river and all the light went out and he was back again in the world he knew beyond the river the land appeared flat and empty UNK and vague until far away it rose again like a wall dark and UNK the sun that lay on lothlurien had no power to UNK the shadow of that distant height there lies the UNK of southern mirkwood said haldir it is clad in a forest of dark UNK where the trees UNK one against another and their branches UNK and UNK in the midst upon a stony height stands dol guldur where long the hidden enemy had his dwelling we fear that now it is inhabited again and with power UNK a black cloud lies often over it of late in this high place you may see the two powers that are UNK one to another and ever they UNK now in thought but UNK the light UNK the very heart of the darkness its own secret has not been discovered not yet he turned and climbed swiftly down and they followed him at the hills foot frodo found aragorn standing still and silent as a tree but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor and a light was in his eyes he was wrapped in some fair memory and as frodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place for the grim years were removed from the face of aragorn and he seemed clothed in white a young lord tall and fair and he spoke words in the elvish tongue to one whom frodo could not see arwen UNK UNK he said and then he drew a breath and returning out of his thought he looked at frodo and smiled here is the heart of UNK on earth he said and here my heart dwells ever unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still must tread you and i come with me  and taking frodos hand in his he left the hill of cerin amroth and came there never again as living man chapter   the mirror of galadriel the sun was sinking behind the mountains and the shadows were UNK in the woods when they went on again their paths now went into thickets where the dusk had already gathered night came beneath the trees as they walked and the elves uncovered their silver lamps suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a pale evening sky UNK by a few early stars there was a wide treeless space before them running in a great circle and bending away on either hand beyond it was a deep UNK lost in soft shadow but the grass upon its brink was green as if it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone upon the further side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a green hill UNK with mallorn-trees taller than any they had yet seen in all the land their height could not be guessed but they stood up in the twilight like living towers in their many UNK branches and amid their UNK leaves countless lights were gleaming green and gold and silver haldir turned towards the company welcome to caras galadhon  he said here is the city of the galadhrim where dwell the lord celeborn and galadriel the lady of lurien but we cannot enter here for the gates do not look northward we must go round to the southern side and the way is not short for the city is great there was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of the UNK along this they went westward with the city ever climbing up like a green cloud upon their left and as the night deepened more lights sprang forth until all the hill seemed UNK with stars they came at last to a white bridge and crossing found the great gates of the city they faced south-west set between the ends of the encircling wall that here UNK and they were tall and strong and hung with many lamps haldir UNK and spoke and the gates opened UNK but of guards UNK could see no sign the travellers passed within and the gates shut behind them they were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall and passing quickly through it they entered the city of the trees no folk could they see nor hear any feet upon the paths but there were many voices about them and in the air above ear away up on the hill they could hear the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves they went along many paths and climbed many stairs until they came to the high places and saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering it was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees and it fell into a basin of silver from which a white stream UNK upon the south side of the lawn there stood the UNK of all the trees its great smooth bole gleamed like grey UNK and up it towered until its first branches far above opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves beside it a broad white ladder stood and at its foot three elves were seated they sprang up as the travellers approached and frodo saw that they were tall and clad in grey mail and from their shoulders hung long white cloaks here dwell celeborn and galadriel said haldir v it is their wish that you should UNK and speak with them one of the UNK then blew a clear note on a small horn and it was answered three times from far above v i will go first said haldir let frodo come next and with him legolas the others may follow as they wish it is a long climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs but you may rest upon the way as he climbed slowly up frodo passed many UNK some on one side some on another and some set about the bole of the tree so that the ladder passed through them at a great height above the ground he came to a wide UNK like the UNK of a great ship on it was built a house so large that almost it would have served for a hall of men upon the earth he entered behind haldir and found that he was in a chamber of UNK shape in the midst of which grew the trunk of the great mallorn now UNK towards its crown and yet making still a pillar of wide UNK the chamber was filled with a soft light its walls were green and silver and its roof of gold many elves were seated there on two chairs beneath the bole of the tree and UNK by a living bough there sat side by side celeborn and galadriel they stood up to greet their guests after the manner of elves even those who were accounted mighty kings very tall they were and the lady no less tall than the lord and they were grave and beautiful they were clad wholly in white and the hair of the lady was of deep gold and the hair of the lord celeborn was of silver long and bright but no sign of age was upon them unless it were in the depths of their eyes for these were keen as UNK in the starlight and yet UNK the wells of deep memory haldir led frodo before them and the lord welcomed him in his own tongue the lady galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face sit now beside my chair frodo of the shire  said celeborn when all have come we will speak together each of the companions he greeted UNK by name as they entered welcome aragorn son of arathorn  he said it is eight and thirty years of the world outside since you came to this land and those years lie heavy on you but the end is near for good or ill here lay aside your burden for a while   welcome son of UNK too seldom do my kindred journey hither from the north welcome gimli son of gluin it is long indeed since we saw one of durins folk in caras galadhon but today we have broken our long UNK may it be a sign that though the world is now dark better days are at hand and that friendship shall be UNK between our UNK gimli bowed low when all the guests were seated before his chair the lord looked at them again here there are eight he said nine were to set out so said the messages but maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have not heard elrond is far away and darkness UNK between us and all this year the shadows have grown longer nay there was no change of counsel said the lady galadriel speaking for the first time her voice was clear and UNK but deeper than UNK wont gandalf the grey set out with the company but he did not pass the borders of this land now tell us where he is for i much desired to speak with him again but i cannot see him from afar unless he comes within the fences of lothlurien a grey mist is about him and the ways of his feet and of his mind are hidden from me alas  said aragorn gandalf the grey fell into shadow he remained in moria and did not escape at these words all the elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and amazement these are evil tidings said celeborn the most evil that have been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds he turned to haldir why has nothing of this been told to me before  he asked in the elven-tongue we have not spoken to haldir of our deeds or our purpose said legolas at first we were weary and danger was too close behind and afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time as we walked in UNK on the fair paths of lurien yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended said frodo gandalf was our guide and he led us through moria and when our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us and he fell tell us now the full tale  said celeborn then aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass of caradhras and in the days that followed and he spoke of balin and his book and the fight in the chamber of mazarbul and the fire and the narrow bridge and the coming of the terror an evil of the ancient world it seemed such as i have never seen before said aragorn it was both a shadow and a flame strong and terrible it was a balrog of UNK said legolas of all UNK the most deadly save the one who UNK in the dark tower indeed i saw upon the bridge that which UNK our UNK dreams  saw durins bane said gimli in a low voice and dread was in his eyes alas  said celeborn we long have feared that under caradhras a terror slept but had i known that the dwarves had stirred up this evil in moria again  would have UNK you to pass the northern borders you and all that went with you and if it were possible one would say that at the last gandalf fell from wisdom into folly going UNK into the UNK of moria he would be UNK indeed that said that thing said galadriel gravely UNK were none of the deeds of gandalf in life those that followed him knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose but however it may be with the guide the UNK are UNK do not UNK of your welcome to the dwarf if our folk had been UNK long and far from lothlurien who of the galadhrim even celeborn the wise would pass nigh and would not wish to look upon their ancient home though it had become an UNK of dragons dark is the water of kheled-zvram and cold are the springs of UNK and fair were the many UNK halls of khazad-dym in elder days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone she looked upon gimli who sat UNK and sad and she smiled and the dwarf hearing the names given in his own ancient tongue looked up and met her eyes and it seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw there love and UNK wonder came into his face and then he smiled in answer he rose UNK and bowed in UNK saying yet more fair is the living land of lurien and the lady galadriel is above all the jewels that lie beneath the earth  there was a silence at length celeborn spoke again i did not know that your plight was so evil he said let gimli forget my harsh words i spoke in the trouble of my heart i will do what i can to aid you each according to his wish and need but especially that one of the little folk who UNK the burden your quest is known to us said galadriel looking at frodo but we will not here speak of it more openly yet not in vain will it prove maybe that you came to this land seeking aid as gandalf himself plainly UNK for the lord of the galadhrim is accounted the UNK of the elves of middle-earth and a UNK of gifts beyond the power of kings he has dwelt in the west since the days of dawn and i have dwelt with him years UNK for ere the fall of UNK or gondolin i passed over the mountains and together through ages of the world we have fought the long defeat i it was who first summoned the white council and if my designs had not gone amiss it would have been UNK by gandalf the grey and then UNK things would have gone otherwise but even now there is hope left i will not give you counsel saying do this or do that for not in doing or UNK nor in choosing between this course and another can i avail but only in knowing what was and is and in part also what shall be but this i will say to you your quest stands upon the edge of a knife stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all yet hope remains while all the company is true and with that word she held them with her eyes and in silence looked UNK at each of them in turn none save legolas and aragorn could long endure her glance sam quickly UNK and hung his head at length the lady galadriel released them from her eyes and she smiled do not let your hearts be troubled she said tonight you shall sleep in peace then they sighed and felt suddenly weary as those who have been questioned long and deeply though no words had been spoken openly go now  said celeborn you are worn with sorrow and much toil even if your quest did not concern us closely you should have refuge in this city until you were healed and refreshed now you shall rest and we will not speak of your further road for a while that night the company slept upon the ground much to the UNK of the hobbits the elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees near the fountain and in it they laid soft UNK then speaking words of peace with fair elvish voices they left them for a little while the travellers talked of their night before in the tree-tops and of their days journey and of the lord and lady for they had not yet the heart to look further back what did you UNK for sam  said pippin you soon broke down anyone would have thought you had a UNK UNK i hope it was nothing worse than a wicked plot to UNK one of my blankets i never thought no such thing answered sam in no mood for UNK if you want to know i felt as if i hadnt got nothing on and i didnt like it she seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what i would do if she gave me the chance of flying back home to the shire to a nice little hole UNK a bit of garden of my own thats funny said merry almost exactly what i felt myself only only well i dont think ill say any more he ended UNK all of them it seemed had UNK alike each had felt that he was offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead and something that he greatly desired clear before his mind it lay and to get it he had only to turn aside from the road and leave the quest and the war against sauron to others and it seemed to me too said gimli that my choice would remain secret and known only to myself to me it seemed exceedingly strange said boromir maybe it was only a test and she thought to read our thoughts for her own good purpose but almost i should have said that she was UNK us and UNK what she UNK to have the power to give it need not be said that i refused to listen the men of minas tirith are true to their word but what he thought that the lady had offered him boromir did not tell and as for frodo he would not speak though boromir pressed him with questions she held you long in her gaze ring UNK he said yes said frodo but whatever came into my mind then i will keep there well have a care said boromir i do not feel too sure of this elvish lady and her purposes speak no evil of the lady galadriel  said aragorn UNK you know not what you say there is in her and in this land no evil unless a man bring it hither himself  then let him UNK  but tonight i shall sleep without fear for the first time since i left rivendell and may i sleep deep and forget for a while my grief i am weary in body and in heart he cast himself down upon his UNK and fell at once into a long sleep the others soon did the same and no sound or dream disturbed their UNK when they woke they found that the light of day was broad upon the lawn before the pavilion and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the sun they remained some days in lothlurien so far as they could tell or remember all the while that they dwelt there the sun shone clear save for a gentle rain that fell at times and passed away leaving all things fresh and clean the air was cool and soft as if it were early spring yet they felt about them the deep and UNK quiet of winter it seemed to them that they did little but eat and drink and rest and walk among the trees and it was enough they had not seen the lord and lady again and they had little speech with the elven-folk for few of these knew or would use the UNK tongue haldir had UNK them farewell and gone back again to the fences of the north where great watch was now kept since the tidings of moria that the company had brought legolas was away much among the galadhrim and after the first night he did not sleep with the other companions though he returned to eat and talk with them often he took gimli with him when he went abroad in the land and the others wondered at this change now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of gandalf and all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their minds as they were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew more keen often they heard nearby elvish voices singing and knew that they were making songs of UNK for his fall for they caught his name among the sweet sad words that they could not understand UNK UNK sang the elves o UNK grey for so they loved to call him but if legolas was with the company he would not UNK the songs for them saying that he had not the skill and that for him the grief was still too near a matter for tears and not yet for song it was frodo who first put something of his sorrow into UNK words he was seldom moved to make song or UNK even in ri vendell he had listened and had not sung himself though his memory was UNK with many things that others had made before him but now as he sat beside the fountain in lurien and heard about him the voices of the elves his thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to him yet when he tried to repeat it to sam only UNK remained faded as a UNK of withered leaves when evening in the shire was grey his footsteps on the hill were heard before the dawn he went away on journey long without a word from wilderland to western shore from northern waste to southern hill through UNK and hidden door and UNK woods he walked at will with dwarf and hobbit elves and men with mortal and UNK folk with bird on bough and beast in UNK in their own secret tongues he spoke a deadly sword a healing hand a back that bent beneath its UNK a UNK a burning brand a weary UNK on the road a lord of wisdom UNK he sat swift in anger quick to laugh an old man in a UNK hat who leaned upon a UNK staff he stood upon the bridge alone and fire and shadow both UNK his staff was broken on the stone in khazad-dym his wisdom died why youll be beating mr bilbo next  said sam no i am afraid not said frodo but that is the best i can do yet well mr frodo if you do have another go i hope youll say a word about his fireworks said sam something like this the UNK UNK ever seen they burst in stars of blue and green or after thunder golden UNK came falling like a rain of flowers though that doesnt do them UNK by a long road no ill leave that to you sam or perhaps to bilbo UNK i cant talk of it any more i cant bear to think of bringing the news to him one evening frodo and sam were walking together in the cool twilight both of them felt restless again on frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen he knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave lothlurien what do you think of elves now sam  he said i asked you the same question once UNK seems a very long while ago but you have seen more of them since then i have indeed  said sam and i reckon theres elves and elves theyre all elvish enough but theyre not all the same now these folk arent wanderers or UNK and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us they seem to belong here more even than UNK do in the shire whether theyve made the land or the lands made them its hard to say if you take my meaning its UNK quiet here nothing seems to be going on and nobody seems to want it to if theres any magic about its right down deep where i cant lay my hands on it in a manner of speaking you can see and feel it everywhere said frodo well said sam you cant see nobody UNK it no fireworks like poor gandalf used to show i wonder we dont see nothing of the lord and lady in all these days i fancy now that she could do some wonderful things if she had a mind id dearly love to see some UNK mr frodo  i wouldnt said frodo i am content and i dont miss gandalfs fireworks but his UNK UNK and his quick UNK and his voice youre right said sam and dont think im finding fault ive often wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of in old tales but ive never heard of a better land than this its like being at home and on a holiday at the same time if you understand me i dont want to leave all the same im beginning to feel that if UNK got to go on then wed best get it over its the job thats never started as takes UNK to finish as my old gaffer used to say and i dont reckon that these folk can do much more to help us magic or no its when we leave this land that we shall miss gandalf worse im thinking i am afraid thats only too true sam said frodo yet i hope very much that before we leave we shall see the lady of the elves again even as he spoke they saw as if she came in answer to their words the lady galadriel approaching tall and white and fair she walked beneath the trees she spoke no word but UNK to them turning aside she led them toward the southern slopes of the hill of caras galadhon and passing through a high green hedge they came into an UNK garden no trees grew there and it lay open to the sky the evening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the western woods down a long flight of steps the lady went into a deep green hollow through which ran UNK the silver stream that issued from the fountain on the hill at the bottom upon a low UNK carved like a branching tree stood a basin of silver wide and shallow and beside it stood a silver UNK with water from the stream galadriel filled the basin to the UNK and breathed on it and when the water was still again she spoke here is the mirror of galadriel she said i have brought you here so that you may look in it if you will the air was very still and the dell was dark and the UNK beside him was tall and pale what shall we look for and what shall we see  asked frodo filled with awe many things i can command the mirror to reveal she answered and to some i can show what they desire to see but the mirror will also show things UNK and those are often stranger and more UNK than things which we wish to behold what you will see if you leave the mirror free to work i cannot tell for it UNK things that were and things that are things that yet may be but which it is that he UNK even the UNK cannot always tell do you wish to look  frodo did not answer and you  she said turning to sam for this is what your folk would call magic i believe though i do not understand clearly what they mean and they seem also to use the same word of the UNK of the enemy but this if you will is the magic of galadriel did you not say that you wished to see UNK  i did said sam trembling a little between fear and curiosity UNK have a UNK lady if youre willing and id not mind a glimpse of whats going on at home he said in an aside to frodo it seems a terrible long time that ive been away but there like as not ill only see the stars or something that i wont understand like as not said the lady with a gentle laugh but come you shall look and see what you may do not touch the water  sam climbed up on the foot of the UNK and leaned over the basin the water looked hard and dark stars were UNK in it theres only stars as i thought he said then he gave a low UNK for the stars went out as if a dark veil had been withdrawn the mirror grew grey and then clear there was sun shining and the branches of trees were waving and tossing in the wind but before sam could make up his mind what it was that he saw the light faded and now he thought he saw frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff then he seemed to see himself going along a dim passage and climbing an endless winding stair it came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something but what it was he did not know like a dream the vision UNK and went back and he saw the trees again but this time they were not so close and he could see what was going on they were not waving in the wind they were falling UNK to the ground UNK cried sam in an UNK voice theres that ted sandyman UNK down trees as he shouldnt they didnt ought to be UNK its that UNK beyond the UNK that shades the road to bywater i wish i could get at ted and id fell UNK but now sam noticed that the old UNK had vanished and a large UNK building was being put up where it had stood lots of folk were UNK at work there was a tall red UNK nearby black smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the mirror theres some UNK at work in the shire he said elrond knew what he was about when he wanted to send mr merry back then suddenly sam gave a cry and sprang away i cant stay here he said wildly i must go home theyve UNK up bagshot row and theres the poor old gaffer going down the hill with his bits of things on a barrow i must go home  you cannot go home alone said the lady you did not wish to go home without your master before you looked in the mirror and yet you knew that evil things might well be UNK in the shire remember that the mirror UNK many things and not all have yet come to pass some never come to be unless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent them the mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands i wish i had never come here and i dont want to see no more magic he said and fell silent after a moment he spoke again UNK as if struggling with tears no ill go home by the long road with mr frodo or not at all he said but i hope i do get back some day if what ive seen turns out true UNK going to catch it hot  do you now wish to look frodo  said the lady galadriel you did not wish to see UNK and were content do you advise me to look  asked frodo no she said i do not counsel you one way or the other i am not a UNK you may learn something and whether what you see be fair or evil that may be UNK and yet it may not seeing is both good and perilous yet i think frodo that you have courage and wisdom enough for the venture or i would not have brought you here do as you will  i will look said frodo and he climbed on the UNK and bent over the dark water at once the mirror cleared and he saw a UNK land mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky a long grey road wound back out of sight far away a figure came slowly down the road faint and small at first but growing larger and clearer as it approached suddenly frodo realized that it UNK him of gandalf he almost called aloud the wizards name and then he saw that the figure was clothed not in grey but in white in a white that shone faintly in the dusk and in its hand there was a white staff the head was so bowed that he could see no face and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and went out of the UNK view doubt came into frodos mind was this a vision of gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago or was it saruman the vision now changed brief and small but very UNK he caught a glimpse of bilbo walking UNK about his room the table was UNK with UNK UNK rain was beating on the windows then there was a UNK and after it many swift UNK followed that frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become UNK the mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before but knew at once the sea darkness fell the sea rose and UNK in a great storm then he saw against the sun sinking UNK into a UNK of clouds the black UNK of a tall ship with UNK UNK riding up out of the west then a wide river flowing through a UNK city then a white fortress with seven towers and then again a ship with black UNK but now it was morning again and the water UNK with light and a UNK bearing the UNK of a white tree shone in the sun a smoke as of fire and battle arose and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey mist and into the mist a small ship passed away twinkling with lights it vanished and frodo sighed and prepared to draw away but suddenly the mirror went altogether dark as dark as if a hole had opened in the world of sight and frodo looked into emptiness in the black UNK there appeared a single eye that slowly grew until it filled nearly all the mirror so terrible was it that frodo stood rooted unable to cry out or to UNK his gaze the eye was UNK with fire but was itself UNK yellow as a UNK watchful and UNK and the black UNK of its UNK opened on a pit a window into nothing then the eye began to UNK searching this way and that and frodo knew with UNK and horror that among the many things that it sought he himself was one but he also knew that it could not see UNK yet not unless he UNK it the ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew heavy heavier than a great stone and his head was dragged downwards the mirror seemed to be growing hot and UNK of steam were rising from the water he was slipping forward do not touch the water said the lady galadriel softly the vision faded and frodo found that he was looking at the cool stars twinkling in the silver basin he stepped back shaking all over and looked at the lady v i know what it was that you last saw she said for that is also in my mind do not be afraid but do not think that only by singing amid the trees nor even by the slender arrows of UNK is this land of lothlurien maintained and UNK against its enemy i say to you frodo that even as i speak to you i perceive the dark lord and know his mind or all of his mind that concerns the elves and he UNK ever to see me and my thought but still the door is closed  she lifted up her white arms and spread out her hands towards the east in a UNK of UNK and UNK edrendil the evening star most beloved of the elves shone clear above so bright was it that the figure of the UNK cast a dim shadow on the ground its UNK glanced upon a ring about her finger it glittered like polished gold UNK with silver light and a white stone in it twinkled as if the UNK had come down to rest upon her hand frodo gazed at the ring with awe for suddenly it seemed to him that he understood yes she said UNK his thought it is not permitted to speak of it and elrond could not do so but it cannot be hidden from the ring UNK and one who has seen the eye UNK it is in the land of lurien upon the finger of galadriel that one of the three remains this is UNK the ring of UNK and i am its keeper he UNK but he does not know  not yet do you not see now UNK your coming is to us as the UNK of doom for if you fail then we are laid bare to the enemy yet if you UNK then our power is UNK and lothlurien will fade and the UNK of time will sweep it away we must depart into the west or UNK to a UNK folk of dell and cave slowly to forget and to be forgotten frodo bent his head and what do you wish  he said at last that what should be shall be she answered the love of the elves for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the sea and their regret is UNK and cannot ever wholly be UNK yet they will cast all away rather than UNK to sauron for they know him now for the fate of lothlurien you are not UNK but only for the doing of your own task yet i could wish were it of any avail that the one ring had never been wrought or had remained for ever lost you are wise and fearless and fair lady galadriel said frodo i will give you the one ring if you ask for it it is too great a matter for me galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh wise the lady galadriel may be she said yet here she has met her match in UNK gently are you UNK for my UNK of your heart at our first meeting you begin to see with a keen eye i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer for many long years i had pondered what i might do should the great ring come into my hands and behold it was brought within my grasp the evil that was UNK long ago works on in many ways whether sauron himself stands or falls would not that have been a noble deed to set to the UNK of his ring if i had taken it by force or fear from my guest and now at last it comes you will give me the ring freely in place of the dark lord you will set up a queen and i shall not be dark but beautiful and terrible as the morning and the night fair as the sea and the sun and the snow upon the mountain dreadful as the storm and the lightning  stronger than the UNK of the earth all shall love me and despair  she lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a great light that UNK her alone and left all else dark she stood before frodo seeming now tall beyond UNK and beautiful beyond UNK terrible and UNK then she let her hand fall and the light faded and suddenly she laughed again and lo she was UNK a slender UNK clad in simple white whose gentle voice was soft and sad i pass the test she said i will UNK and go into the west and remain galadriel they stood for a long while in silence at length the lady spoke again let us return  she said in the morning you must depart for now we have chosen and the UNK of fate are flowing i would ask one thing before we go said frodo a thing which i often meant to ask gandalf in rivendell i am permitted to wear the one ring why cannot i see all the others and know the thoughts of those that wear them  you have not tried she said only UNK have you set the ring upon your finger since you knew what you possessed do not try it would destroy you did not gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of each UNK before you could use that power you would need to become far stronger and to UNK your will to the UNK of others yet even so as ring-bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden your sight is grown UNK you have perceived my thought more clearly than many that are accounted wise you saw the eye of him that holds the seven and the nine and did you not see and UNK the ring upon my finger did you see my ring  she asked turning again to sam no lady he answered to tell you the truth i wondered what you were talking about i saw a star through your finger but if youll pardon my speaking out i think my master was right i wish youd take his ring youd put things to UNK youd stop them UNK up the gaffer and turning him UNK youd make some folk pay for their UNK work i would she said that is how it would begin but it would not stop with that alas we will not speak more of it let us go chapter   farewell to lurien that night the company was again summoned to the chamber of celeborn and there the lord and lady greeted them with fair words at length celeborn spoke of their departure now is the time he said when those who wish to UNK the quest must UNK their hearts to leave this land those who no longer wish to go forward may remain here for a while but whether they stay or go none can be sure of peace for we are come now to the edge of doom here those who wish may UNK the UNK of the hour till either the ways of the world lie open again or we UNK them to the last need of lurien then they may return to their own lands or else go to the long home of those that fall in battle there was a silence they all UNK to go forward said galadriel looking in their eyes as for me said boromir my way home lies UNK and not back that is true said celeborn but is all this company going with you to minas tirith  we have not decided our course said aragorn beyond lothlurien i do not know what gandalf intended to do indeed i do not think that even he had any clear purpose maybe not said celeborn yet when you leave this land you can no longer forget the great river as some of you know well it cannot be crossed by travellers with baggage between lurien and gondor save by boat and are not the bridges of osgiliath broken down and all the UNK held now by the enemy on which side will you journey the way to minas tirith lies upon this side upon the west but the straight road of the quest lies east of the river upon the darker shore which shore will you now take  if my advice is heeded it will be the western shore and the way to minas tirith answered boromir but i am not the leader of the company the others said nothing and aragorn looked doubtful and troubled i see that you do not yet know what to do said celeborn it is not my part to choose for you but i will help you as i may there are some among you who can handle boats legolas whose folk know the swift forest river and boromir of gondor and aragorn the traveller and one hobbit  cried merry not all of us look on boats as wild horses my people live by the banks of the brandywine that is well said celeborn then i will UNK your company with boats they must be small and light for if you go far by water there are places where you will be forced to carry them you will come to the rapids of sarn gebir and maybe at last to the great falls of rauros where the river UNK down from UNK UNK and there are other perils boats may make your journey less UNK for UNK yet they will not give you counsel in the end you must leave them and the river and turn UNK east aragorn UNK celeborn many times the gift of boats UNK him much not least because there would now be no need to decide his course for some days the others too looked more hopeful whatever perils lay ahead it seemed better to UNK down the broad UNK of anduin to meet them than to UNK forward with bent backs only sam was doubtful he at any rate still thought boats as bad as wild horses or worse and not all the dangers that he had survived made him think better of them all shall be prepared for you and UNK you at the UNK before noon tomorrow said celeborn i will send my people to you in the morning to help you make ready for the journey now we will wish you all a fair night and UNK sleep good night my friends  said galadriel sleep in peace do not trouble your hearts UNK with thought of the road tonight maybe the paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet though you do not see them good night  the company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion legolas went with them for this was to be their last night in lothlurien and in spite of the words of galadriel they wished to take counsel together for a long time they UNK what they should do and how it would be best to attempt the UNK of their purpose with the ring but they came to no decision it was plain that most of them desired to go first to minas tirith and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the enemy they would have been willing to follow a leader over the river and into the shadow of mordor but frodo spoke no word and aragorn was still divided in his mind his own plan while gandalf remained with them had been to go with boromir and with his sword help to UNK gondor for he believed that the message of the dreams was a UNK and that the hour had come at last when the heir of elendil should come forth and UNK with sauron for the UNK but in moria the burden of gandalf had been laid on him and he knew that he could not now UNK the ring if frodo refused in the end to go with boromir and yet what help could he or any of the company give to frodo save to walk blindly with him into the darkness i shall go to minas tirith alone if need be for it is my UNK said boromir and after that he was silent for a while sitting with his eyes fixed on frodo as if he was trying to read the halflings thoughts at length he spoke again softly as if he was UNK with himself if you wish only to destroy the ring he said then there is little use in war and weapons and the men of minas tirith cannot help but if you wish to destroy the UNK might of the dark lord then it is folly to go without force into his domain and folly to throw away he paused suddenly as if he had become aware that he was speaking his thoughts aloud it would be folly to throw lives away i mean he ended it is a choice between UNK a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death at least that is how i see it frodo caught something new and strange in boromirs glance and he looked hard at him plainly boromirs thought was different from his final words it would be folly to throw away what the ring of power he had said something like this at the council but then he had accepted the UNK of elrond frodo looked at aragorn but he seemed deep in his own thought and made no sign that he had heeded boromirs words and so their debate ended merry and pippin were already asleep and sam was nodding the night was growing old in the morning as they were beginning to pack their slender goods elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts of food and UNK for the journey the food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes made of a meal that was UNK a light brown on the outside and inside was the colour of UNK gimli took up one of the cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye UNK he said under his breath as he broke off a UNK corner and UNK at it his expression quickly changed and he ate all the rest of the UNK with UNK no more no more cried the elves laughing you have eaten enough already for a long days march i thought it was only a kind of UNK  such as the UNK make for journeys in the wild said the dwarf so it is they answered but we call it UNK or UNK and it is more UNK than any food made by men and it is more pleasant than UNK by all accounts indeed it is said gimli why it is better than the UNK of the beornings and that is great praise for the beornings are the best UNK that i know of but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes to travellers in these days you are kindly hosts  all the same we bid you spare the food they said eat little at a time and only at need for these things are given to serve you when all else fails the cakes will keep sweet for many many days if they are unbroken and left in their UNK UNK as we have brought them one will keep a traveller on his feet for a day of long UNK even if he be one of the tall men of minas tirith the elves next UNK and gave to each of the company the clothes they had brought for each they had UNK a hood and cloak made according to his size of the light but warm UNK stuff that the galadhrim UNK it was hard to say of what colour they were grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they seemed to be and yet if they were moved or set in another light they were green as UNK leaves or brown as UNK fields by night UNK as water under the stars each cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf UNK with silver are these magic cloaks  asked pippin looking at them with wonder i do not know what you mean by that answered the leader of the elves they are fair garments and the UNK is good for it was made in this land they are elvish robes certainly if that is what you mean leaf and branch water and stone they have the hue and beauty of all these things under the twilight of lurien that we love for we put the thought of all that we love into all that we make yet they are garments not UNK and they will not turn shaft or blade but they should serve you well they are light to wear and warm enough or cool enough at need and you will find them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes whether you walk among the stones or the trees you are indeed high in the UNK of the lady for she herself and her UNK UNK this stuff and never before have we clad strangers in the UNK of our own people after their morning meal the company said farewell to the lawn by the fountain their hearts were heavy for it was a fair place and it had become like home to them though they could not count the days and nights that they had passed there as they stood for a moment looking at the white water in the sunlight haldir came walking towards them over the green grass of the glade frodo greeted him with delight i have returned from the northern fences said the elf and i am sent now to be your guide again the dimrill dale is full of UNK and clouds of smoke and the mountains are troubled there are noises in the deeps of the earth if any of you had thought of returning northwards to your UNK you would not have been able to pass that way but come your path now goes south as they walked through caras galadhon the green ways were empty but in the trees above them many voices were UNK and singing they themselves went silently at last haldir led them down the southward slopes of the hill and they came again to the great gate hung with lamps and to the white bridge and so they passed out and left the city of the elves then they turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a deep thicket of mallorn-trees and passed on winding through rolling woodlands of silver shadow leading them ever down southwards and eastwards towards the shores of the river they had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a high green wall passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the trees before them lay a long lawn of shining grass studded with golden elanor that glinted in the sun the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright UNK on the right and west the silverlode flowed glittering on the left and east the great river rolled its broad waters deep and dark on the further shores the woodlands still marched on southwards as far as the eye could see but all the banks were bleak and bare no mallorn lifted its UNK boughs beyond the land of lurien on the bank of the silverlode at some distance up from the meeting of the streams there was a UNK of white stones and white wood by it were moored many boats and UNK some were brightly UNK and shone with silver and gold and green but most were either white or grey three small grey boats had been made ready for the travellers and in these the elves stowed their goods and they added also UNK of rope three to each boat slender they looked but strong UNK to the touch grey of hue like the UNK what are these  asked sam UNK one that lay upon the UNK ropes indeed  answered an elf from the boats never travel far without a rope and one that is long and strong and light such are these they may be a help in many needs you dont need to tell me that  said sam i came without any and ive been worried ever since but i was wondering what these were made of knowing a bit about rope UNK its in the family as you might say they are made of UNK said the elf but there is no time now to UNK you in the art of their making had we known that this craft delighted you we could have taught you much but now alas unless you should at some time return hither you must be content with our gift may it serve you well   come  said haldir all is now ready for you enter the boats but take care at first  heed the words  said the other elves these boats are UNK and they are UNK and UNK the boats of other folk they will not sink UNK them as you will but they are UNK if UNK it would be wise if you accustomed yourselves to UNK in and out here where there is a UNK before you set off UNK the company was UNK in this way aragorn frodo and sam were in one boat boromir merry and pippin in another and in the third were legolas and gimli who had now become fast friends in this last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed the boats were moved and steered with UNK paddles that had broad UNK blades when all was ready aragorn led them on a UNK up the silverlode the current was swift and they went forward slowly sam sat in the bows clutching the sides and looking back UNK to the shore the sunlight glittering on the water UNK his eyes as they passed beyond the green field of the tongue the trees drew down to the rivers brink here and there golden leaves tossed and floated on the rippling stream the air was very bright and still and there was a silence except for the high distant song of UNK they turned a sharp bend in the river and there sailing proudly down the stream toward them they saw a swan of great size the water UNK on either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck its UNK shone like UNK gold and its eyes glinted like UNK set in yellow stones its huge white wings were half lifted a music came down the river as it drew nearer and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship wrought and carved with UNK in the UNK of a bird two elves clad in white steered it with black paddles in the midst of the UNK sat celeborn and behind him stood galadriel tall and white a circlet of golden flowers was in her hair and in her hand she held a UNK and she sang sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in the cool clear air i sang of leaves of leaves of gold and leaves of gold there grew of wind i sang a wind there came and in the branches blew beyond the sun beyond the moon the foam was on the sea and by the UNK of UNK there grew a golden tree beneath the stars of UNK in UNK it shone in UNK beside the walls of UNK UNK there long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years while here beyond the UNK seas now fall the UNK o lurien the winter comes the bare and UNK day the leaves are falling in the stream the river flows away o lurien too long i have dwelt upon this hither shore and in a fading crown have UNK the golden elanor but if of ships i now should sing what ship would come to me what ship would bear me ever back across so wide a sea aragorn stayed his boat as the UNK drew UNK the lady ended her song and greeted them we have come to bid you our last farewell she said and to speed you with UNK from our land though you have been our guests said celeborn you have not yet eaten with us and we bid you therefore to a parting feast here between the flowing waters that will bear you far from lurien the swan passed on slowly to the UNK and they turned their boats and followed it there in the last end of UNK upon the green grass the parting feast was held but frodo ate and drank little UNK only the beauty of the lady and her voice she seemed no longer perilous or terrible nor filled with hidden power already she seemed to him as by men of later days elves still at times are seen present and yet remote a living vision of that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of time after they had eaten and UNK sitting upon the grass celeborn spoke to them again of their journey and lifting his hand he pointed south to the woods beyond the tongue as you go down the water he said you will find that the trees will fail and you will come to a barren country there the river flows in stony vale amid high moors until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall island of the tindrock that we call tol brandir there it UNK its arms about the steep shores of the isle and falls then with a great noise and smoke over the UNK of rauros down into the UNK the UNK as it is called in your tongue that is a wide region of UNK UNK where the stream becomes UNK and much divided there the entwash flows in by many mouths from the forest of fangorn in the west about that stream on this side of the great river lies rohan on the further side are the bleak hills of the emyn muil the wind UNK from the east there for they look out over the dead marshes and the UNK to UNK UNK and the black gates of mordor boromir and any that go with him seeking minas tirith will do well to leave the great river above rauros and cross the entwash before it finds the marshes yet they should not go too far up that stream nor risk becoming UNK in the forest of fangorn that is a strange land and is now little known but boromir and aragorn doubtless do not need this warning indeed we have heard of fangorn in minas tirith said boromir but what i have heard seems to me for the most part old UNK tales such as we tell to our children all that lies north of rohan is now to us so far away that fancy can wander freely there of old fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm but it is now many lives of men since any of us visited it to prove or UNK the legends that have come down from distant years i have myself been at UNK in rohan but i have never crossed it northwards when i was sent out as a messenger i passed through the gap by the skirts of the white mountains and crossed the UNK and the grey flood into UNK a long and UNK journey four hundred leagues i reckoned it and it took me many months for i lost my horse at UNK at the UNK of the greyflood after that journey and the road i have trodden with this company i do not much doubt that i shall find a way through rohan and fangorn too if need be then i need say no more said celeborn but do not UNK the lore that has come down from distant years for oft it may chance that old UNK keep in memory word of things that once were UNK for the wise to know now galadriel rose from the grass and taking a cup from one of her UNK she filled it with white UNK and gave it to celeborn now it is time to drink the cup of farewell she said drink lord of the galadhrim and let not your heart be sad though night must follow noon and already our evening UNK nigh then she brought the cup to each of the company and bade them drink and farewell but when they had UNK she commanded them to sit again on the grass and chairs were set for her and for celeborn her UNK stood silent about her and a while she looked upon her guests at last she spoke again we have UNK the cup of parting she said and the shadows fall between us but before you go i have brought in my ship gifts which the lord and lady of the galadhrim now offer you in memory of lothlurien then she called to each in turn here is the gift of celeborn and galadriel to the leader of your company she said to aragorn and she gave him a sheath that had been made to fit his sword it was UNK with a UNK of flowers and leaves wrought of silver and gold and on it were set in UNK runes formed of many gems the name andril and the UNK of the sword the blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or broken even in defeat she said but is there UNK else that you desire of me at our parting for darkness will flow between us and it may be that we shall not meet again unless it be far UNK upon a road that has no returning and aragorn answered lady you know all my desire and long held in keeping the only treasure that i seek yet it is not yours to give me even if you would and only through darkness shall i come to it yet maybe this will UNK your heart said galadriel for it was left in my care to be given to you should you pass through this land then she lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green set in a silver brooch that was wrought in the UNK of an eagle with UNK wings and as she held it up the UNK flashed like the sun shining through the leaves of spring this stone i gave to UNK my daughter and she to UNK and now it comes to you as a token of hope in this hour take the name that was UNK for you UNK the UNK of the house of elendil  then aragorn took the stone and UNK the brooch upon his breast and those who saw him wondered for they had not marked before how tall and UNK he stood and it seemed to them that many years of toil had fallen from his shoulders for the gifts that you have given me i thank you he said o lady of lurien of whom were UNK UNK and arwen UNK what praise could i say more  the lady bowed her head and she turned then to boromir and to him she gave a belt of gold and to merry and pippin she gave small silver UNK each with a UNK wrought like a golden flower to legolas she gave a bow such as the galadhrim used longer and UNK than the bows of mirkwood and UNK with a string of UNK with it went a quiver of arrows for you little UNK and UNK of trees she said to sam i have only a small gift she put into his hand a little box of plain grey wood UNK save for a single silver UNK upon the lid here is set g for galadriel she said but also it may stand for garden in your tongue in this box there is earth from my UNK and such UNK as galadriel has still to UNK is upon it it will not keep you on your road nor UNK you against any peril but if you keep it and see your home again at last then perhaps it may reward you though you should find all barren and laid waste there will be few gardens in middle-earth that will bloom like your garden if you UNK this earth there then you may remember galadriel and catch a glimpse far off of lurien that you have seen only in our winter for our spring and our summer are gone by and they will never be seen on earth again save in memory sam went red to the ears and muttered something UNK as he clutched the box and bowed as well as he could and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves  said galadriel turning to gimli none lady answered gimli it is enough for me to have seen the lady of the galadhrim and to have heard her gentle words hear all UNK elves  she cried to those about her let none say again that dwarves are UNK and UNK yet surely gimli son of gluin you desire something that i could give name it i bid you you shall not be the only guest without a gift there is nothing lady galadriel said gimli bowing low and UNK nothing unless it might UNK it is permitted to ask nay to name a single UNK of your hair which UNK the gold of the earth as the stars UNK the gems of the mine i do not ask for such a gift but you commanded me to name my desire the elves stirred and murmured with astonishment and celeborn gazed at the dwarf in wonder but the lady smiled it is said that the skill of the dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues  she said yet that is not true of gimli for none have ever made to me a UNK so bold and yet so UNK and how shall i refuse since i commanded him to speak but tell me what would you do with such a gift  treasure it lady he answered in memory of your words to me at our first meeting and if ever i return to the UNK of my home it shall be set in UNK crystal to be an UNK of my house and a UNK of good will between the mountain and the wood until the end of days then the lady UNK one of her long UNK and cut off three golden UNK and laid them in UNK hand these words shall go with the gift she said i do not UNK for all UNK is now vain on the one hand lies darkness and on the other only hope but if hope should not fail then i say to you gimli son of gluin that your hands shall flow with gold and yet over you gold shall have no dominion and you ring-bearer she said turning to frodo i come to you last who are not last in my thoughts for you i have prepared this she held up a small crystal UNK it glittered as she moved it and UNK of white light sprang from her hand in this UNK she said is caught the light of UNK star set amid the waters of my fountain it will shine still brighter when night is about you may it be a light to you in dark places when all other lights go out remember galadriel and her mirror  frodo took the UNK and for a moment as it shone between them he saw her again standing like a queen great and beautiful but no longer terrible he bowed but found no words to say now the lady arose and celeborn led them back to the UNK a yellow noon lay on the green land of the tongue and the water glittered with silver all at last was made ready the company took their places in the boats as before crying farewell the elves of lurien with long grey UNK thrust them out into the flowing stream and the rippling waters bore them slowly away the travellers sat still without moving or speaking on the green bank near to the very point of the tongue the lady galadriel stood alone and silent as they passed her they turned and their eyes watched her slowly floating away from them for so it seemed to them lurien was slipping UNK like a bright ship UNK with enchanted trees sailing on to forgotten shores while they sat UNK upon the UNK of the grey and UNK world even as they gazed the silverlode passed out into the UNK of the great river and their boats turned and began to speed southwards soon the white form of the lady was small and distant she shone like a window of glass upon a far hill in the westering sun or as a remote lake seen from a mountain a crystal fallen in the lap of the land then it seemed to frodo that she lifted her arms in a final farewell and far but UNK on the following wind came the sound of her voice singing but now she sang in the ancient tongue of the elves beyond the sea and he did not understand the words fair was the music but it did not comfort him yet as is the way of elvish words they remained UNK in his memory and long afterwards he UNK them as well as he could the language was that of UNK and spoke of things little known on middle-earth ai UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK i UNK UNK UNK UNK man UNK UNK UNK an UNK UNK varda UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK i UNK UNK met UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK valimar UNK UNK UNK valimar UNK UNK UNK UNK ah like gold fall the leaves in the wind long years UNK as the wings of trees  the long years have passed like swift UNK of the sweet UNK in lofty halls beyond the west beneath the blue UNK of varda UNK the stars tremble in the song of her voice UNK and UNK who now shall UNK the cup for me for now the UNK varda the queen of the stars from mount UNK has UNK her hands like clouds and all paths are drowned deep in shadow and out of a grey country darkness lies on the foaming waves between us and mist UNK the jewels of UNK for ever now lost lost to those from the east is valimar farewell maybe UNK UNK find valimar maybe even UNK UNK find it farewell  varda is the name of that UNK whom the elves in these lands of exile name elbereth suddenly the river swept round a bend and the banks rose upon either side and the light of UNK was hidden to that fair land frodo never came again the travellers now turned their faces to the journey the sun was before them and their eyes were UNK for all were filled with tears gimli wept openly i have looked the last upon that which was fairest he said to UNK his companion UNK i will call nothing fair unless it be her gift he put his hand to his breast tell me UNK why did i come on this quest UNK did i know where the chief peril lay UNK elrond spoke saying that we could not UNK what we might meet upon our road torment in the dark was the danger that i feared and it did not hold me back but i would not have come had i known the danger of light and joy now i have taken my worst wound in this parting even if i were to go this night straight to the dark ford alas for gimli son of gluin  nay  said UNK alas for us all and for all that walk the world in these UNK for such is the way of it to find and lose as it seems to those whose boat is on the running stream but i count you blessed gimli son of gluin for your loss you suffer of your own free will and you might have chosen otherwise but you have not forsaken your companions and the least reward that you shall have is that the memory of UNK shall remain ever clear and UNK in your heart and shall neither fade nor grow UNK maybe said gimli and i thank you for your words true words doubtless yet all such comfort is cold memory is not what the heart desires that is only a mirror be it clear as kheled-zvram or so says the heart of gimli the dwarf elves may see things otherwise indeed i have heard that for them memory is more like to the waking world than to a dream not so for dwarves but let us talk no more of it look to the boat she is too low in the water with all this baggage and the great river is swift i do not wish to UNK my grief in cold water he took up a paddle and steered towards the western bank following aragorns boat ahead which had already moved out of the middle stream so the company went on their long way down the wide hurrying waters borne ever southwards bare woods UNK along either bank and they could not see any glimpse of the lands behind the breeze died away and the river flowed without a sound no voice of bird broke the silence the sun grew misty as the day grew old until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl then it faded into the west and dusk came early followed by a grey and UNK night far into the dark quiet hours they floated on UNK their boats under the UNK shadows of the western woods great trees passed by like UNK UNK their twisted thirsty roots through the mist down into the water it was dreary and cold frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and UNK of the river UNK among the UNK and UNK near the shore until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy sleep chapter   the great river frodo was roused by sam he found that he was lying well wrapped under tall grey UNK trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west bank of the great river anduin he had slept the night away and the grey of morning was dim among the bare branches gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand they started again before the day was broad not that most of the company were eager to hurry southwards they were content that the decision which they must make at latest when they came to rauros and the tindrock isle still lay some days ahead and they let the river bear them on at its own pace having no desire to UNK towards the perils that lay beyond UNK course they took in the end aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished UNK their strength against weariness to come but he insisted that at least they should start early each day and journey on far into the evening for he felt in his heart that time was UNK and he feared that the dark lord had not been idle while they lingered in lurien nonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day nor the next the dull grey hours passed without event as the third day of their UNK wore on the lands changed slowly the trees UNK and then failed altogether on the eastern bank to their left they saw long UNK slopes stretching up and away toward the sky brown and withered they looked as if fire had passed over them leaving no living blade of green an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree or a bold stone to UNK the emptiness they had come to the brown lands that lay vast and desolate between southern mirkwood and the hills of the emyn muil what UNK or war or evil deed of the enemy had so UNK all that region even aragorn could not tell upon the west to their right the land was treeless also but it was flat and in many places green with wide plains of grass on this side of the river they passed UNK of great reeds so tall that they shut out all view to the west as the little boats went UNK by along their fluttering borders their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the light cold UNK hissing softly and sadly here and there through UNK frodo could catch sudden glimpses of rolling UNK and far beyond them hills in the sunset and away on the edge of sight a dark line where marched the UNK UNK of the misty mountains there was no sign of living moving things save birds of these there were many small UNK whistling and UNK in the reeds but they were seldom seen once or twice the travellers heard the rush and UNK of UNK and looking up they saw a great UNK streaming along the sky swans  said sam and mighty big ones too  yes said aragorn and they are black swans how wide and empty and UNK all this country looks  said frodo i always imagined that as one journeyed south it got warmer and UNK until winter was left behind for ever but we have not journeyed far south yet answered aragorn it is still winter and we are far from the sea here the world is cold until the sudden spring and we may yet have snow again far away down in the bay of UNK to which anduin runs it is warm and merry maybe or would be but for the enemy but here we are not above sixty leagues i guess south of the southfarthing away in your shire hundreds of long miles yonder you are looking now south-west across the north plains of the UNK rohan the land of the UNK ere long we shall come to the mouth of the UNK that runs down from fangorn to join the great river that is the north UNK of rohan and of old all that lay between UNK and the white mountains belonged to the UNK it is a rich and pleasant land and its grass has no UNK but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the river or ride often to its shores anduin is wide yet the ores can shoot their arrows far across the stream and of late it is said they have dared to cross the water and UNK the UNK and UNK of rohan sam looked from bank to bank uneasily the trees had seemed UNK before as if they UNK secret eyes and UNK dangers now he wished that the trees were still there he felt that the company was too naked UNK in little open boats in the midst of UNK lands and on a river that was the UNK of war in the next day or two as they went on borne steadily southwards this feeling of UNK grew on all the company for a whole day they took to their paddles and hastened forward the banks UNK by soon the river UNK and grew more shallow long stony UNK lay upon the east and there were UNK in the water so that careful UNK was needed the brown lands rose into bleak UNK over which flowed a chill air from the east on the other side the UNK had become rolling downs of withered grass UNK a land of UNK and UNK frodo shivered thinking of the UNK and fountains the clear sun and gentle UNK of lothlurien there was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats each member of the company was busy with his own thoughts the heart of legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in some northern glade amid the UNK woods gimli was fingering gold in his mind and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the UNK of the UNK gift merry and pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease for boromir sat muttering to himself sometimes biting his UNK as if some UNK or doubt UNK him sometimes UNK a paddle and driving the boat close behind aragorns then pippin who sat in the bow looking back caught a queer gleam in his eye as he peered forward gazing at frodo sam had long ago made up his mind that though boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been brought up to believe they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined fie was UNK and miserable having nothing to do but UNK at the winter UNK crawling by and the grey water on either side of him even when the paddles were in use they did not trust sam with one as dusk drew down on the UNK day he was looking back over the bowed heads of frodo and aragorn and the following boats he was UNK and longed for camp and the feel of earth under his toes suddenly something caught his sight at first he stared at it UNK then he sat up and rubbed his eyes but when he looked again he could not see it any more that night they camped on a small UNK close to the western bank sam lay rolled in blankets beside frodo v i had a funny dream an hour or two before we stopped mr frodo he said or maybe it wasnt a dream funny it was anyway well what was it  said frodo knowing that sam would not settle down until he had told his tale whatever it was i havent seen or thought of anything to make me smile since we left lothlurien it wasnt funny that way mr frodo it was queer all wrong if it wasnt a dream and you had best hear it it was like this i saw a log with eyes  the UNK all right said frodo there are many in the river but leave out the eyes   that i wont said sam  UNK the eyes as made me sit up so to speak i saw what i took to be a log floating along in the UNK behind UNK boat but i didnt give much heed to it then it seemed as if the log was slowly catching us up and that was peculiar as you might say seeing as we were all floating on the stream together just then i saw the eyes two pale sort of points UNK UNK on a UNK at the near end of the log whats more it wasnt a log for it had UNK like a swans almost only they seemed UNK and kept UNK in and out of the water thats when i sat right up and rubbed my eyes meaning to give a shout if it was still there when i had rubbed the UNK out of my head for the whatever UNK was coming along fast now and getting close behind gimli but whether those two lamps UNK me moving and staring or whether i came to my senses i dont know when i looked again it wasnt there yet i think i caught a glimpse with the tail UNK eye as the saying is of something dark UNK under the shadow of the bank i couldnt see no more eyes though i said to myself dreaming again sam gamgee i said and i said no more just then but ive been thinking since and now im not so sure what do you make of it mr frodo  i should make nothing of it but a log and the dusk and sleep in your eyes sam said frodo if this was the first time that those eyes had been seen but it isnt i saw them away back north before we reached lurien and i saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night haldir saw it too and do you remember the report of the elves that went after the UNK  ah said sam i do and i remember more too i dont like my thoughts but thinking of one thing and another and mr bilbos stories and all i fancy i could put a name on the creature at a guess a nasty name gollum maybe  yes that is what i have feared for some time said frodo ever since the night on the flet i suppose he was UNK in moria and picked up our trail then but i hoped that our stay in lurien would throw him off the scent again the miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods by the silverlode watching us start off  thats about it said sam and wed better be a bit more watchful ourselves or well feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of these nights if we ever wake up to feel anything and thats what i was leading up to no need to trouble strider or the others tonight ill keep watch i can sleep tomorrow being no more than luggage in a boat as you might say v i might said frodo and i might say luggage with eyes you shall watch but only if you promise to wake me UNK towards morning if nothing UNK before then in the dead hours frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find sam shaking him its a UNK to wake you whispered sam but thats what you said theres nothing to tell or not much i thought i heard some soft UNK and a sniffing noise a while back but you hear a lot of such queer sounds by a river at night he lay down and frodo sat up huddled in his blankets and fought off his sleep minutes or hours passed slowly and nothing happened frodo was just UNK to the UNK to lie down again when a dark shape hardly visible floated close to one of the moored boats a long UNK hand could be dimly seen as it shot out and UNK the UNK two pale UNK eyes shone UNK as they peered inside and then they lifted and gazed up at frodo on the UNK they were not more than a yard or two away and frodo heard the soft hiss of UNK breath he stood up drawing sting from its sheath and faced the eyes immediately their light was shut off there was another hiss and a splash and the dark UNK shot away UNK into the night aragorn stirred in his sleep turned over and sat up what is it  he whispered springing up and coming to frodo i felt something in my sleep why have you drawn your sword  gollum answered frodo or at least so i guess ah  said aragorn so you know about our little UNK do you he UNK after us all through moria and right down to nimrodel since we took to boats he has been lying on a log and UNK with hands and feet i have tried to catch him once or twice at night but he is UNK than a UNK and as UNK as a fish i hoped the UNK would beat him but he is too clever a UNK we shall have to try going faster tomorrow you lie down now and i will keep watch for what is left of the night i wish i could lay my hands on the UNK we might make him useful but if i cannot we shall have to try and lose him he is very dangerous quite apart from murder by night on his own account he may put any enemy that is about on our track the night passed without gollum UNK so much as a shadow again after that the company kept a sharp UNK but they saw no more of gollum while the UNK UNK if he was still following he was very wary and cunning at aragorns bidding they paddled now for long UNK and the banks went swiftly by but they saw little of the country for they journeyed mostly by night and twilight UNK by day and lying as hidden as the land allowed in this way the time passed without event until the UNK day the weather was still grey and UNK with wind from the east but as evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared and pools of faint light yellow and pale green opened under the grey shores of cloud there the white UNK of the new moon could be seen glimmering in the remote UNK sam looked at it and UNK his brows the next day the country on either side began to change UNK the banks began to rise and grow stony soon they were passing through a UNK rocky land and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep UNK of UNK and UNK tangled with brambles and UNK behind them stood low crumbling cliffs and UNK of grey UNK stone dark with UNK and beyond these again there rose high ridges crowned with UNK UNK they were drawing near to the grey hill UNK of the emyn muil the southern march of wilderland there were many birds about the cliffs and the UNK and all day high in the air UNK of birds had been circling black against the pale sky as they lay in their camp that day aragorn watched the UNK doubtfully wondering if gollum had been doing some mischief and the news of their UNK was now moving in the wilderness later as the sun was setting and the company was UNK and getting ready to start again he UNK a dark spot against the fading light a great bird high and far off now UNK now flying on slowly southwards what is that legolas  he asked pointing to the northern sky is it as i think an eagle  yes said legolas it is an eagle a hunting eagle i wonder what that UNK it is far from the mountains we will not start until it is fully dark said aragorn the UNK night of their journey came it was silent and UNK the grey east wind had passed away the thin UNK of the moon had fallen early into the pale sunset but the sky was clear above and though far away in the south there were great UNK of cloud that still shone faintly in the west stars glinted bright come  said aragorn we will venture one more journey by night we are coming to reaches of the river that i do not know well for i have never journeyed by water in these parts before not between here and the rapids of sarn gebir but if i am right in my reckoning those are still many miles ahead still there are dangerous places even before we come there rocks and stony UNK in the stream we must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly to sam in the leading boat was given the task of UNK he lay forward peering into the gloom the night grew dark but the stars above were strangely bright and there was a glimmer on the face of the river it was close on midnight and they had been UNK for some while hardly using the paddles when suddenly sam cried out only a few yards ahead dark shapes loomed up in the stream and he heard the UNK of UNK water there was a swift current which swung left towards the eastern shore where the channel was clear as they were swept aside the travellers could see now very close the pale foam of the river UNK against sharp rocks that were thrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth the boats were all huddled together hoy there aragorn  shouted boromir as his boat UNK into the leader this is madness we cannot dare the rapids by night but no boat can live in sarn gebir be it night or day back back  cried aragorn turn turn if you can  he drove his paddle into the water trying to hold the boat and bring it round i am out of my reckoning he said to frodo i did not know that we had come so far anduin flows faster than i thought sarn gebir must be close at hand already with great UNK they UNK the boats and slowly brought them about but at first they could make only small UNK against the current and all the time they were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night all together paddle  shouted boromir paddle or we shall be driven on the UNK even as he spoke frodo felt the UNK beneath him UNK upon stone at that moment there was a UNK of UNK several arrows whistled over them and some fell among them one smote frodo between the shoulders and he UNK forward with a cry letting go his paddle but the arrow fell back UNK by his hidden coat of mail another passed through aragorns hood and a third stood fast in the UNK of the second boat close by merrys hand sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and fro upon the long UNK UNK that lay under the eastern shore they seemed very near  UNK  said legolas falling into his own tongue ores  cried gimli gollums doing ill be bound said sam to frodo and a nice place to choose too the river seems set on taking us right into their arms  they all leaned forward UNK at the paddles even sam took a hand every moment they expected to feel the bite of black UNK arrows many whined overhead or struck the water nearby but there were no more UNK it was dark but not too dark for the UNK of ores and in the UNK they must have offered their cunning foes some mark unless it was that the grey cloaks of lurien and the grey UNK of the UNK wrought boats defeated the malice of the UNK of mordor stroke by stroke they UNK on in the darkness it was hard to be sure that they were indeed moving at all but slowly the UNK of the water grew less and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the night at last as far as they could judge they had reached the middle of the stream again and had driven their boats back some distance above the UNK rocks then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards the western shore under the shadow of bushes leaning out over the water they halted and drew breath legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought from lurien then he sprang UNK and climbed a few UNK up the bank UNK the bow and UNK an arrow he turned peering back over the river into the darkness across the water there were shrill cries but nothing could be seen frodo looked up at the elf standing tall above him as he gazed into the night seeking a mark to shoot at his head was dark crowned with sharp white stars that glittered in the black pools of the sky behind but now rising and sailing up from the south the great clouds advanced UNK out dark UNK into the starry fields a sudden dread fell on the company  elbereth gilthoniel sighed legolas as he looked up even as he did so a dark shape like a cloud and yet not a cloud for it moved far more swiftly came out of the UNK in the south and sped towards the company UNK out all light as it approached soon it appeared as a great UNK creature UNK than the UNK in the night fierce voices rose up to greet it from across the water frodo felt a sudden chill running through him and clutching at his heart there was a deadly cold like the memory of an old wound in his shoulder he crouched down as if to hide suddenly the great bow of lurien sang shrill went the arrow from the UNK frodo looked up almost above him the UNK shape UNK there was a harsh UNK UNK as it fell out of the air vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shore the sky was clean again there was a UNK of many voices far away cursing and wailing in the darkness and then silence neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night after a while aragorn led the boats back UNK they felt their way along the waters edge for some distance until they found a small shallow bay a few low trees grew there close to the water and behind them rose a steep rocky bank here the company decided to stay and UNK the dawn it was useless to attempt to move further by night they made no camp and lit no fire but lay huddled in the boats moored close together UNK be the bow of galadriel and the hand and eye of legolas   said gimli as he UNK a UNK of UNK that was a mighty shot in the dark my friend but who can say what it UNK said legolas i cannot said gimli but i am glad that the shadow came no nearer i liked it not at all too much it UNK me of the shadow in moria  the shadow of the balrog he ended in a whisper it was not a balrog said frodo still shivering with the chill that had come upon him it was something UNK i think it was   then he paused and fell silent what do you think  asked boromir eagerly leaning from his boat as if he was trying to catch a glimpse of frodos face i think  no i will not say answered frodo whatever it was its fall has dismayed our enemies so it seems said aragorn yet where they are and how many and what they will do next we do not know this night we must all be UNK dark UNK us now but what the day will show who can tell have your weapons close to hand  sam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were UNK on his fingers and looking up at the sky its very strange he murmured the UNK the same in the shire and in wilderland or it ought to be but either its out of its running or im all wrong in my reckoning youll remember mr frodo the moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that tree a week from the full i reckon and wed been a week on the way last night when up UNK a new moon as thin as a UNK as if we had never stayed no time in the elvish country well i can remember three nights there for certain and i seem to remember several more but i would take my UNK it was never a whole month anyone would think that time did not count in there  and perhaps that was the way of it said frodo in that land maybe we were in a time that has elsewhere long gone by it was not i think until silverlode bore us back to anduin that we returned to the time that flows through mortal lands to the great sea and i dont remember any moon either new or old in caras galadhon only stars by night and sun by day legolas stirred in his boat nay time does not UNK ever he said but change and UNK is not in all things and places alike for the elves the world UNK and it UNK both very swift and very slow swift because they themselves change little and all else UNK by it is a grief to them slow because they do not count the running years not for themselves the passing UNK are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream yet beneath the sun all things must wear to an end at last but the wearing is slow in lurien said frodo the power of the lady is on it rich are the hours though short they seem in caras galadhon where galadriel UNK the UNK that should not have been said outside lurien not even to me said aragorn speak no more of it but so it is sam in that land you lost your count there time flowed swiftly by us as for the elves the old moon passed and a new moon UNK and waned in the world outside while we UNK there and UNK a new moon came again winter is nearly gone time flows on to a spring of little hope the night passed silently no voice or call was heard again across the water the travellers huddled in their boats felt the changing of the weather the air grew warm and very still under the great UNK clouds that had floated up from the south and the distant seas the rushing of the river over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow louder and closer the UNK of the trees above them began to UNK when the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and sad slowly the dawn grew to a pale light UNK and UNK there was mist on the river and white fog UNK the shore the far bank could not be seen i cant UNK fog said sam but this seems to be a lucky one now perhaps we can get away without those cursed UNK seeing us perhaps so said aragorn but it will be hard to find the path unless the fog UNK a little later on and we must find the path if we are to pass sarn gebir and come to the emyn muil i do not see why we should pass the rapids or follow the river any further said boromir if the emyn muil lie before us then we can UNK these UNK and strike westward and southward until we come to the entwash and cross into my own land we can if we are making for minas tirith said aragorn but that is not yet agreed and such a course may be more perilous than it sounds the vale of entwash is flat and UNK and fog is a deadly peril there for those on foot and laden i would not UNK our boats until we must the river is at least a path that cannot be missed but the enemy holds the eastern bank UNK boromir and even if you pass the gates of argonath and come UNK to the tindrock what will you do then leap down the falls and land in the marshes  no  answered aragorn say rather that we will bear our boats by the ancient way to UNK and there take to the water again do you not know boromir or do you choose to forget the north stair and the high seat upon amon hen that were made in the days of the great kings i at least have a mind to stand in that high place again before i decide my further course there maybe we shall see some sign that will guide us boromir held out long against this choice but when it became plain that frodo would follow aragorn wherever he went he gave in it is not the way of the men of minas tirith to UNK their friends at need he said and you will need my strength if ever you are to reach the tindrock to the tall isle i will go but no further there i shall turn to my home alone if my help has not UNK the reward of any UNK the day was now growing and the fog had lifted a little it was decided that aragorn and legolas should at once go forward along the shore while the others remained by the boats aragorn hoped to find some way by which they could carry both their boats and their baggage to the UNK water beyond the rapids boats of the elves would not sink maybe he said but that does not say that we should come through sarn gebir alive none have ever done so yet no road was made by the men of gondor in this region for even in their great days their realm did not reach up anduin beyond the emyn muil but there is a portage-way somewhere on the western shore if i can find it it cannot yet have perished for light boats used to journey out of wilderland down to osgiliath and still did so until a few years ago when the ores of mordor began to UNK seldom in my life has any boat come out of the north and the ores UNK on the UNK said boromir if you go forward peril will grow with every mile even if you find a path peril lies ahead on every southward road answered aragorn wait for us one day if we do not return in that time you will know that evil has indeed befallen us then you must take a new leader and follow him as best you can it was with a heavy heart that frodo saw aragorn and legolas climb the steep bank and vanish into the mists but his fears proved UNK only two or three hours had passed and it was UNK mid-day when the shadowy shapes of the UNK appeared again all is well said aragorn as he clambered down the bank there is a track and it UNK to a good landing that is still UNK the distance is not great the head of the rapids is but half a mile below us and they are little more than a mile long not far beyond them the stream becomes clear and smooth again though it runs swiftly our UNK task will be to get our boats and baggage to the old UNK way we have found it but it lies well back from the UNK here and runs under the UNK of a UNK a UNK or more from the shore we did not find where the northward landing lies if it still remains we must have passed it yesterday night we might UNK far UNK and yet miss it in the fog i fear we must leave the river now and make for the portage-way as best we can from here that would not be easy even if we were all men said boromir yet such as we are we will try it said aragorn UNK we will said gimli the legs of men will UNK on a rough road while a dwarf goes on be the burden twice his own weight master boromir  the task proved hard indeed yet in the end it was done the goods were taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank where there was a level space then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up they were far less heavy than any had expected of what tree growing in the elvish country they were made not even legolas knew but the wood was tough and yet strangely light merry and pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat nonetheless it needed the strength of the two men to UNK and UNK them over the ground that the company now had to cross it UNK up away from the river a tumbled waste of grey UNK with many hidden holes shrouded with UNK and bushes there were thickets of brambles and sheer dells and here and there UNK pools UNK by waters UNK from the UNK further UNK one by one boromir and aragorn carried the boats while the others UNK and scrambled after them with the baggage at last all was removed and laid on the portage-way then with little further UNK save from UNK UNK and many fallen stones they moved forward all together fog still hung in UNK upon the crumbling UNK and to their left mist shrouded the river they could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp UNK and stony teeth of sarn gebir but they could not see it twice they made the journey before all was brought safe to the southern landing there the portage-way turning back to the UNK ran gently down to the shallow edge of a little pool it seemed to have been UNK in the UNK not by hand but by the water swirling down from sarn gebir against a low UNK of rock that UNK out some way into the stream beyond it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff and there was no further passage for those on foot already the short afternoon was past and a dim UNK dusk was closing in they sat beside the water listening to the UNK rush and roar of the rapids hidden in the mist they were tired and sleepy and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day well here we are and here we must pass another night said boromir we need sleep and even if aragorn had a mind to pass the gates of argonath by night we are all too UNK no doubt our sturdy dwarf gimli made no reply he was nodding as he sat let us rest as much as we can now said aragorn tomorrow we must journey by day again unless the weather changes once more and UNK us we shall have a good chance of slipping through unseen by any eyes on the eastern shore but tonight two must watch together in turns three hours off and one on guard nothing happened that night worse than a brief UNK of rain an hour before dawn as soon as it was fully light they started already the fog was UNK they kept as close as they could to the western side and they could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher shadowy walls with their feet in the hurrying river in the UNK the clouds drew down lower and it began to rain heavily they drew the skin UNK over their boats to prevent them from being UNK and UNK on little could be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtains the rain however did not last long slowly the sky above grew lighter and then suddenly the clouds broke and their UNK UNK trailed away northward up the river the UNK and mists were gone before the travellers lay a wide ravine with great rocky sides to which UNK upon UNK and in narrow UNK a few UNK trees the channel grew UNK and the river UNK now they were UNK along with little hope of UNK or turning whatever they might meet ahead over them was a lane of UNK sky around them the dark overshadowed river and before them black UNK out the sun the hills of emyn muil in which no opening could be seen frodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching like great UNK or pillars of stone they seemed tall and sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of the stream a narrow gap appeared between them and the river swept the boats towards it behold the argonath the pillars of the kings  cried aragorn we shall pass them soon keep the boats in line and as far apart as you can hold the middle of the stream  as frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to meet him giants they seemed to him vast grey figures silent but threatening then he saw that they were indeed shaped and UNK the craft and power of old had wrought upon them and still they preserved through the UNK and UNK of forgotten years the mighty UNK in which they had been hewn upon great UNK founded in the deep waters stood two great kings of stone still with blurred eyes and UNK brows they UNK upon the north the left hand of each was raised UNK outwards in UNK of warning in each right hand there was an axe upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown great power and UNK they still wore the silent UNK of a long UNK kingdom awe and fear fell upon frodo and he UNK down UNK his eyes and not UNK to look up as the boat drew near even boromir bowed his head as the boats UNK by UNK and UNK as little leaves under the UNK shadow of the UNK of nmenor so they passed into the dark chasm of the gates sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to UNK heights on either side far off was the dim sky the black waters roared and UNK and a wind UNK over them frodo crouching over his knees heard sam in front muttering and UNK what a place what a horrible place just let me get out of this boat and ill never wet my toes in a UNK again let alone a river  fear not said a strange voice behind him frodo turned and saw strider and yet not strider for the UNK ranger was no longer there in the stern sat aragorn son of arathorn proud and UNK UNK the boat with skilful UNK his hood was cast back and his dark hair was blowing in the wind a light was in his eyes a king returning from exile to his own land fear not  he said long have i desired to look upon the UNK of isildur and anbrion my UNK of old under their shadow UNK the UNK son of arathorn of the house of valandil isildurs son heir of elendil has UNK to dread  then the light of his eyes faded and he spoke to himself would that gandalf were here how my heart UNK for minas anor and the walls of my own city but whither now shall i go  the chasm was long and dark and filled with the noise of wind and rushing water and echoing stone it bent somewhat towards the west so that at first all was dark ahead but soon frodo saw a tall gap of light before him ever growing swiftly it drew near and suddenly the boats shot through out into a wide clear light the sun already long fallen from the noon was shining in a UNK sky the UNK waters spread out into a long UNK lake pale UNK UNK UNK by steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees but their heads were bare UNK in the sunlight at the far southern end rose three peaks the UNK stood somewhat forward from the others and UNK from them an island in the waters about which the flowing river flung pale shimmering arms distant but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound like the roll of thunder heard far away behold tol brandir  said aragorn pointing south to the tall peak upon the left stands amon lhaw and upon the right is amon hen the hills of hearing and of sight in the days of the great kings there were high UNK upon them and watch was kept there but it is said that no foot of man or beast has ever been set upon tol brandir ere the shade of night falls we shall come to them i hear the endless voice of rauros calling the company rested now for a while UNK south on the current that flowed through the middle of the lake they ate some food and then they took to their paddles and hastened on their way the sides of the westward hills fell into shadow and the sun grew round and red here and there a misty star peered out the three peaks loomed before them UNK in the twilight rauros was roaring with a great voice already night was laid on the flowing waters when the travellers came at last under the shadow of the hills the UNK day of their journey was over wilderland was behind them they could go no further without choice between the UNK and the west the last stage of the quest was before them chapter  the breaking of the fellowship aragorn led them to the right arm of the river here upon its western side under the shadow of tol brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from the feet of amon hen behind it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill clad with trees and trees marched away westward along the curving shores of the lake a little spring fell UNK down and UNK the grass here we will rest tonight said aragorn this is the lawn of UNK UNK a fair place in the summer days of old let us hope that no evil has yet come here they drew up their boats on the green banks and beside them they made their camp they set a watch but had no sight nor sound of their enemies if gollum had UNK to follow them he remained unseen and UNK nonetheless as the night wore on aragorn grew uneasy tossing often in his sleep and waking in the small hours he got up and came to frodo whose turn it was to watch why are you waking  asked frodo it is not your watch i do not know answered aragorn but a shadow and a threat has been growing in my sleep it would be well to draw your sword why  said frodo are enemies at hand  let us see what sting may show answered aragorn frodo then drew the UNK from its sheath to his dismay the edges gleamed dimly in the night ores  he said not very near and yet too near it seems i feared as much said aragorn but maybe they are not on this side of the river the light of sting is faint and it may point to no more than spies of mordor UNK on the slopes of amon lhaw i have never heard before of ores upon amon hen yet who knows what may happen in these evil days now that minas tirith no longer holds UNK the passages of anduin we must go warily tomorrow the day came like fire and smoke low in the east there were black UNK of cloud like the UNK of a great burning the rising sun lit them from beneath with flames of UNK red but soon it climbed above them into a clear sky the summit of tol brandir was tipped with gold frodo looked out eastward and gazed at the tall island its sides sprang sheer out of the running water high up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which trees climbed mounting one head above another and above them again were grey faces of UNK rock crowned by a great UNK of stone many birds were circling about it but no sign of other living things could be seen when they had eaten aragorn called the company together the day has come at last he said the day of choice which we have long delayed what shall now become of our company that has travelled so far in fellowship shall we turn west with boromir and go to the wars of gondor or turn east to the fear and shadow or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and that as each may choose whatever we do must be done soon we cannot long halt here the enemy is on the eastern shore we know but i fear that the ores may already be on this side of the water there was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved well frodo said aragorn at last i fear that the burden is laid upon you you are the bearer UNK by the council your own way you alone can choose in this matter i cannot advise you i am not gandalf and though i have tried to bear his part i do not know what UNK or hope he had for this hour if indeed he had any most likely it seems that if he were here now the choice would still wait on you such is your fate frodo did not answer at once then he spoke slowly i know that haste is needed yet i cannot choose the burden is heavy give me an hour longer and i will speak let me be alone  aragorn looked at him with kindly pity very well frodo son of drogo he said you shall have an hour and you shall be alone we will stay here for a while but do not stray far or out of call frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed sam who had been watching his master with great concern shook his head and muttered plain as a UNK it is but its no good sam gamgee putting in his spoke just now presently frodo got up and walked away and sam saw that while the others UNK themselves and did not UNK at him the eyes of boromir followed frodo intently until he passed out of sight in the trees at the foot of amon hen wandering UNK at first in the wood frodo found that his feet were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill he came to a path the UNK ruins of a road of long ago in steep places stairs of stone had been hewn but now they were cracked and worn and UNK by the roots of trees for some while he climbed not UNK which way he went until he came to a grassy place UNK grew about it and in the midst was a wide flat stone the little UNK lawn was open upon the east and was filled now with the early sunlight frodo halted and looked out over the river far below him to tol brandir and the birds UNK in the great UNK of air between him and the UNK isle the voice of rauros was a mighty roaring mingled with a deep UNK UNK he sat down upon the stone and UNK his chin in his hands staring eastwards but seeing little with his eyes all that had happened since bilbo left the shire was passing through his mind and he recalled and pondered everything that he could remember of gandalf s words time went on and still he was no nearer to a choice suddenly he awoke from his thoughts a strange feeling came to him that something was behind him that unfriendly eyes were upon him he sprang up and turned but all that he saw to his surprise was boromir and his face was smiling and kind i was afraid for you frodo he said coming forward if aragorn is right and ores are near then none of us should wander alone and you least of all so much depends on you and my heart too is heavy may i stay now and talk for a while since i have found you it would comfort me where there are so many all speech becomes a debate without end but two together may perhaps find wisdom you are kind answered frodo but i do not think that any speech will help me for i know what i should do but i am afraid of doing it boromir afraid boromir stood silent rauros roared endlessly on the wind murmured in the branches of the trees frodo shivered suddenly boromir came and sat beside him are you sure that you do not suffer UNK  he said i wish to help you you need counsel in your hard choice will you not take mine  i think i know already what counsel you would give boromir said frodo and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart warning warning against what  said boromir sharply against delay against the way that seems easier against UNK of the burden that is laid on me against UNK if it must be said against trust in the strength and truth of men yet that strength has long UNK you far away in your little country though you knew it not i do not doubt the valour of your people but the world is changing the walls of minas tirith may be strong but they are not strong enough if they fail what then  we shall fall in battle UNK yet there is still hope that they will not fail no hope while the ring lasts said frodo ah the ring  said boromir his eyes UNK the ring is it not a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a thing so small a thing and i have seen it only for an instant in the house of elrond could i not have a sight of it again  frodo looked up his heart went suddenly cold he caught the strange gleam in boromirs eyes yet his face was still kind and friendly it is best that it should lie hidden he answered as you wish i care not said boromir yet may i not even speak of it for you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the enemy of its evil uses not of its good the world is changing you say minas tirith will fall if the ring lasts but why certainly if the ring were with the enemy but why if it were with us  were you not at the council  answered frodo because we cannot use it and what is done with it turns to evil boromir got up and walked about impatiently so you go on he cried gandalf elrond  all these folk have taught you to say so for themselves they may be right these elves and UNK and wizards they would come to grief perhaps yet often i doubt if they are wise and not merely timid but each to his own kind UNK men they will not be UNK we of minas tirith have been UNK through long years of UNK we do not desire the power of UNK only strength to UNK ourselves strength in a just cause and behold in our need chance brings to light the UNK of power it is a gift i say a gift to the foes of mordor it is mad not to use it to use the power of the enemy against him the fearless the UNK these alone will UNK victory what could not a UNK do in this hour a great leader what could not aragorn do or if he UNK why not boromir the ring would give me power of command how i would drive the hosts of mordor and all men would UNK to my UNK boromir strode up and down speaking ever more loudly almost he seemed to have forgotten frodo while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons and the UNK of men and he drew plans for great UNK and UNK UNK to be and he cast down mordor and became himself a mighty king UNK and wise suddenly he stopped and waved his arms and they tell us to throw it away he cried i do not say destroy it that might be well if reason could show any hope of doing so it does not the only plan that is UNK to us is that a halfling should walk blindly into mordor and offer the enemy every chance of UNK it for himself folly surely you see it my friend he said turning now suddenly to frodo again you say that you are afraid if it is so the UNK should pardon you but is it not really your good sense that UNK no i am afraid said frodo simply afraid but i am glad to have heard you speak so fully my mind is clearer now then you will come to minas tirith  cried boromir his eyes were shining and his face eager you UNK me said frodo but you will come at least for a while  boromir UNK my city is not far now and it is little further from there to mordor than from here we have been long in the wilderness and you need news of what the enemy is doing before you make a move come with me frodo he said you need rest before your venture if go you must he laid his hand on the hobbits shoulder in friendly fashion but frodo felt the hand trembling with UNK excitement he stepped quickly away and UNK with alarm the tall man nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength why are you so unfriendly  said boromir i am a true man neither thief nor UNK i need your ring that you know now but i give you my word that i do not desire to keep it will you not at least let me make UNK of my plan UNK me the ring  no no  cried frodo the council laid it upon me to bear it it is by our own folly that the enemy will defeat us cried boromir how it UNK me fool UNK fool running UNK to death and UNK our cause if any mortals have claim to the ring it is the men of nmenor and not halflings it is not yours save by UNK chance it might have been mine it should be mine give it to me   frodo did not answer but moved away till the great flat stone stood between them come come my friend  said boromir in a UNK voice why not get rid of it why not be free of your doubt and fear you can lay the blame on me if you will you can say that i was too strong and took it by force for i am too strong for you halfling he cried and suddenly he sprang over the stone and leaped at frodo his fair and pleasant face was UNK changed a UNK fire was in his eyes frodo UNK aside and again put the stone between them there was only one thing he could do trembling he pulled out the ring upon its chain and quickly slipped it on his finger even as boromir sprang at him again the man gasped stared for a moment UNK and then ran wildly about seeking here and there among the rocks and trees miserable UNK he shouted let me get my hands on you now i see your mind you will take the ring to sauron and sell us all you have only waited your chance to leave us in the UNK UNK you and all halflings to death and darkness   then catching his foot on a stone he fell UNK and lay upon his face for a while he was as still as if his own UNK had struck him down then suddenly he wept he rose and passed his hand over his eyes UNK away the tears what have i said  he cried what have i done frodo frodo  he called come back a madness took me but it has passed come back  there was no answer frodo did not even hear his cries he was already far away leaping blindly up the path to the hill-top terror and grief shook him seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of boromir and his burning eyes soon he came out alone on the summit of amon hen and halted UNK for breath he saw as through a mist a wide flat circle paved with mighty UNK and UNK with a crumbling UNK and in the middle set upon four carven pillars was a high seat reached by a stair of many steps up he went and sat upon the ancient chair feeling like a lost child that had clambered upon the throne of mountain UNK at first he could see little he seemed to be in a world of mist in which there were only shadows the ring was upon him then here and there the mist gave way and he saw many visions small and clear as if they were under his eyes upon a table and yet remote there was no sound only bright living UNK the world seemed to have UNK and fallen silent he was sitting upon the seat of seeing on amon hen the hill of the eye of the men of nmenor eastward he looked into wide UNK lands nameless plains and UNK UNK northward he looked and the great river lay like a UNK beneath him and the misty mountains stood small and hard as broken teeth westward he looked and saw the broad UNK of rohan and orthanc the pinnacle of isengard like a black UNK southward he looked and below his very feet the great river curled like a UNK wave and plunged over the falls of rauros into a foaming pit a glimmering UNK played upon the UNK and UNK anduin he saw the mighty UNK of the river and UNK of UNK UNK like a white dust in the sun and beneath them a green and silver sea rippling in endless lines but everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war the misty mountains were crawling like UNK ores were UNK out of a thousand holes under the boughs of mirkwood there was deadly UNK of elves and men and fell beasts the land of the beornings was UNK a cloud was over moria smoke rose on the borders of lurien horsemen were galloping on the grass of rohan wolves UNK from isengard from the havens of UNK ships of war put out to sea and out of the east men were moving endlessly UNK UNK UNK upon horses UNK of chieftains and laden UNK all the power of the dark lord was in UNK then turning south again he beheld minas tirith far away it seemed and beautiful UNK many UNK proud and fair upon its UNK seat its UNK glittered with steel and its UNK were bright with many UNK hope leaped in his heart but against minas tirith was set another fortress greater and more strong thither eastward UNK his eye was drawn it passed the ruined bridges of osgiliath the UNK gates of minas morgul and the UNK mountains and it looked upon UNK the valley of terror in the land of mordor darkness lay there under the sun fire glowed amid the smoke mount doom was burning and a great UNK rising then at last his gaze was held wall upon wall UNK upon UNK black UNK strong mountain of iron gate of steel tower of UNK he saw it UNK fortress of sauron all hope left him and suddenly he felt the eye there was an eye in the dark tower that did not sleep he knew that it had become aware of his gaze a fierce eager will was there it leaped towards him almost like a finger he felt it searching for him very soon it would UNK him down know just exactly where he was amon lhaw it touched it glanced upon tol brandir he threw himself from the seat crouching UNK his head with his grey hood he heard himself crying out never never or was it UNK i come i come to you  he could not tell then as a flash from some other point of power there came to his mind another thought take it off take it off fool take it off take off the ring the two powers UNK in him for a moment UNK UNK between their piercing points he UNK UNK suddenly he was aware of himself again frodo neither the voice nor the eye free to choose and with one remaining instant in which to do so he took the ring off his finger he was UNK in clear sunlight before the high seat a black shadow seemed to pass like an arm above him it missed amon hen and groped out west and faded then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in every tree frodo rose to his feet a great weariness was on him but his will was firm and his heart lighter he spoke aloud to himself t will do now what i must he said this at least is plain the evil of the ring is already at work even in the company and the ring must leave them before it does more harm i will go alone some i cannot trust and those i can trust are too dear to me poor old sam and merry and pippin strider too his heart UNK for minas tirith and he will be needed there now boromir has fallen into evil i will go alone at once he went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where boromir had found him then he halted listening he thought he could hear cries and UNK from the woods near the shore below theyll be hunting for me he said t wonder how long i have been away hours i should think he hesitated what can i do  he muttered i must go now or i shall never go i shant get a chance again i hate leaving them and like this without any explanation but surely they will understand sam will and what else can i do slowly he drew out the ring and put it on once more he vanished and passed down the hill less than a rustle of the wind the others remained long by the river UNK for some time they had been silent moving UNK about but now they were sitting in a circle and they were talking every now and again they made UNK to speak of other things of their long road and many adventures they questioned aragorn concerning the realm of gondor and its ancient history and the UNK of its great works that could still be seen in this strange border UNK of the emyn muil the stone kings and the UNK of lhaw and hen and the great stair beside the falls of rauros but always their thoughts and words strayed back to frodo and the ring what would frodo choose to do why was he hesitating he is UNK which course is the most desperate i think said aragorn and well he may it is now more UNK than ever for the company to go east since we have been UNK by gollum and must fear that the secret of our journey is already betrayed but minas tirith is no nearer to the fire and the UNK of the burden we may remain there for a while and make a brave stand but the lord denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even elrond said was beyond his power either to keep the burden secret or to hold off the full might of the enemy when he comes to take it which way would any of us choose in frodos place i do not know now indeed we miss gandalf most grievous is our loss said legolas yet we must needs make up our minds without his aid why cannot we decide and so help frodo let us call him back and then vote i should vote for minas tirith and so should i said gimli we of course were only sent to help the bearer along the road to go no further than we wished and none of us is under any UNK or command to seek mount doom hard was my parting from lothlurien yet i have come so far and i say this now we have reached the last choice it is clear to me that i cannot leave frodo i would choose minas tirith but if he does not then i follow him and i too will go with him said legolas it would be UNK now to say farewell it would indeed be a UNK if we all left him said aragorn but if he goes east then all need not go with him nor do i think that all should that venture is desperate as much so for eight as for three or two or one alone if you would let me choose then i should UNK three companions sam who could not bear it otherwise and gimli and myself boromir will return to his own city where his father and his people need him and with him the others should go or at least meriadoc and peregrin if legolas is not willing to leave us that wont do at all  cried merry we cant leave frodo pippin and i always intended to go wherever he went and we still do but we did not UNK what that would mean it seemed different so far away in the shire or in ri vendell it would be mad and cruel to let frodo go to mordor why cant we stop him we must stop him said pippin and that is what he is worrying about i am sure he knows we shant agree to his going east and he doesnt like to ask anyone to go with him poor old fellow imagine it going off to mordor alone  pippin shuddered but the dear silly old hobbit he ought to know that he hasnt got to ask he ought to know that if we cant stop him we shant leave him begging your pardon said sam i dont think you understand my master at all he isnt hesitating about which way to go of course not whats the good of minas tirith anyway to him i mean begging your pardon master boromir he added and turned it was then that they discovered that boromir who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle was no longer there now wheres he got to  cried sam looking worried hes been a bit queer lately to my mind but anyway hes not in this business hes off to his home as he always said and no blame to him but mr frodo he knows hes got to find the cracks of doom if he can but hes afraid now its come to the point hes just plain terrified thats what his trouble is of course hes had a bit of UNK so to UNK all UNK we left home or hed be so terrified hed just fling the ring in the river and bolt but hes still too frightened to start and he isnt worrying about us either whether well go along with him or no he knows we mean to thats another thing thats UNK him if he UNK himself up to go hell want to go alone mark my words were going to have trouble when he comes back for hell UNK himself up all right as sure as his names baggins i believe you speak more UNK than any of us sam said aragorn and what shall we do if you prove right  stop him dont let him go  cried pippin i wonder  said aragorn he is the bearer and the fate of the burden is on him i do not think that it is our part to drive him one way or the other nor do i think that we should UNK if we tried there are other powers at work far stronger well i wish frodo would UNK himself up and come back and let us get it over said pippin this waiting is horrible surely the time is up f yes said aragorn the hour is long passed the morning is wearing away we must call for him at that moment boromir reappeared he came out from the trees and walked towards them without speaking his face looked grim and sad he paused as if UNK those that were present and then sat down UNK with his eyes on the ground where have you been boromir  asked aragorn have you seen frodo  boromir hesitated for a second yes and no he answered slowly yes i found him some way up the hill and i spoke to him i urged him to come to minas tirith and not to go east i grew angry and he left me he vanished i have never seen such a thing happen before though i have heard of it in tales he must have put the ring on i could not find him again i thought he would return to you is that all that you have to say  said aragorn looking hard and not too kindly at boromir yes he answered i will say no more yet this is bad cried sam UNK up i dont know what this man has been up to why should mr frodo put the thing on he didnt ought to have and if he has UNK knows what may have happened but he wouldnt keep it on  said merry not when he had escaped the UNK UNK like bilbo used to but where did he go where is he  cried pippin hes been away ages now how long is it since you saw frodo last boromir  asked aragorn half an hour maybe he answered or it might be an hour i have wandered for some time since i do not know i do not know  he put his head in his hands and sat as if bowed with grief an hour since he vanished  shouted sam we must try and find him at once come on  wait a moment  cried aragorn we must UNK up into UNK and UNK hold on wait  it was no good they took no notice of him sam had dashed off first merry and pippin had followed and were already disappearing westward into the trees by the shore shouting frodo frodo  in their clear high UNK voices legolas and gimli were running a sudden UNK or madness seemed to have fallen on the company we shall all be scattered and lost UNK aragorn boromir i do not know what part you have played in this mischief but help now go after those two young hobbits and guard them at the least even if you cannot find frodo come back to this spot if you find him or any UNK of him i shall return soon aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of sam just as he reached the little lawn among the UNK he UNK him UNK UNK UNK and calling frodo come with me sam  he said none of us should be alone there is mischief about i feel it i am going to the top to the seat of amon hen to see what may be seen and look it is as my heart guessed frodo went this way follow me and keep your eyes open  he sped up the path sam did his best but he could not keep up with strider the ranger and soon fell behind he had not gone far before aragorn was out of sight ahead sam stopped and puffed suddenly he clapped his hand to his head whoa sam gamgee  he said aloud your legs are too short so use your head let me see now boromir isnt lying thats not his way but he hasnt told us everything something scared mr frodo UNK he UNK himself up to the point sudden he made up his mind at last to go where to off east not without sam yes without even his sam thats hard cruel hard sam passed his hand over his eyes UNK away the tears steady gamgee  he said think if you can he cant fly across rivers and he cant UNK UNK hes got no gear so hes got to get back to the boats back to the boats back to the boats sam like lightning  sam turned and bolted back down the path he fell and cut his knees up he got and ran on he came to the edge of the lawn of UNK UNK by the shore where the boats were drawn up out of the water no one was there there seemed to be cries in the woods behind but he did not heed them he stood gazing for a moment UNK gaping a boat was UNK down the bank all by itself with a shout sam UNK across the grass the boat slipped into the UNK UNK UNK coming mr frodo coming  called sam and flung himself from the bank clutching at the departing boat he missed it by a yard with a cry and a splash he fell face UNK into deep swift water gurgling he went under and the river closed over his UNK head an UNK of dismay came from the empty boat a paddle swirled and the boat put about frodo was just in time to grasp sam by the hair as he came up bubbling and struggling fear was staring in his round brown eyes up you come sam my lad  said frodo now take my hand  save me mr frodo  gasped sam im drownded i cant see your hand here it is dont UNK lad i wont let you go tread water and dont UNK or youll UNK the boat there now get hold of the side and let me use the paddle  with a few UNK frodo brought the boat back to the bank and sam was able to UNK out wet as a UNK frodo took off the ring and stepped UNK again of all the UNK UNK you are the worst sam  he said oh mr frodo thats hard  said sam shivering thats hard trying to go without me and all if i hadnt a guessed right where would you be now  safely on my way safely  said sam all alone and without me to help you i couldnt have a borne it UNK have been the death of me it would be the death of you to come with me sam said frodo and i could not have borne that not as certain as being left behind said sam but i am going to mordor i know that well enough mr frodo of course you are and im coming with you now sam said frodo dont hinder me the others will be coming back at any minute if they catch me here i shall have to UNK and explain and i shall never have the heart or the chance to get off but i must go at once its the only way of course it is answered sam but not alone im coming too or neither of us isnt going ill knock holes in all the boats first frodo actually laughed a sudden UNK and UNK touched his heart leave one he said well need it but you cant come like this without your gear or food or anything just hold on a moment and ill get my stuff cried sam eagerly its all ready i thought we should be off today he rushed to the UNK place UNK out his pack from the pile where frodo had laid it when he UNK the boat of his companions goods UNK a spare blanket and some UNK UNK of food and ran back so all my plan is UNK  said frodo it is no good trying to escape you but im glad sam i cannot tell you how glad come along it is plain that we were meant to go together we will go and may the others find a safe road strider will look after them i dont suppose we shall see them again yet we may mr frodo we may said sam so frodo and sam set off on the last stage of the quest together frodo paddled away from the shore and the river bore them swiftly away down the western arm and past the UNK cliffs of tol brandir the roar of the great falls drew nearer even with such help as sam could give it was hard work to pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive the boat eastward towards the far shore at length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of amon lhaw there they found a UNK shore and they drew the boat out high above the water and hid it as well as they could behind a great UNK then UNK their burdens they set off seeking a path that would bring them over the grey hills of the emyn muil and down into the land of shadow here ends the first part of the history of the war of the ring the second part is called the two towers since the events recounted in it are UNK by orthanc the UNK of saruman and the fortress UNK morgul that guards the secret entrance to mordor it tells of the deeds and perils of all the members of the now UNK fellowship until the coming of the great darkness the third part tells of the last defence against the shadow and the end of the UNK of the ring-bearer in the return of the king
