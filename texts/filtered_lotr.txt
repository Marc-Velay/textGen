hobbits came cut hundreds trees made great bonfire forest burned ground long strip east hedge trees gave attack became unfriendly still wide bare space far inside bonfire made trees dangerous asked pippin various queer things living deep forest far side said merry least heard never seen something makes paths whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks seem shift change time time queer fashion far tunnel long time beginning quite broad path leading bonfire glade less direction east little north path going try find hobbits left tunnel-gate rode across wide hollow far side faint path leading floor forest hundred yards beyond hedge vanished soon brought trees looking back could see dark line hedge stems trees already thick looking ahead could see tree-trunks innumerable sizes shapes straight bent twisted leaning squat slender smooth gnarled branched stems green grey moss slimy shaggy growths merry alone seemed fairly cheerful better lead find path frodo said dont let us lose one another forget way hedge lies picked way among trees ponies plodded along carefully avoiding many writhing interlacing roots undergrowth ground rising steadily went forward seemed trees became taller darker thicker sound except occasional drip moisture falling still leaves moment whispering movement among branches got uncomfortable feeling watched disapproval deepening dislike even enmity feeling steadily grew found looking quickly glancing back shoulders expected sudden blow yet sign path trees seemed constantly bar way pippin suddenly felt could bear longer without warning let

possible find way right make others come abominable wood merry looking side side seemed already uncertain way go pippin noticed taken long lose us said moment merry gave whistle relief pointed ahead well well said trees shift bonfire glade front us hope path seems moved away light grew clearer went forward suddenly came trees found wide circular space sky blue clear surprise forest -roof able see rising morning lifting mist sun however high enough yet shine clearing though light tree-tops leaves thicker greener edges glade enclosing almost solid wall tree grew rough grass many tall plants stalky faded hemlocks wood-parsley fire-weed seeding fluffy ashes rampant nettles thistles dreary place seemed charming cheerful garden close forest hobbits felt encouraged looked hopefully broadening daylight sky far side glade break wall trees clear path beyond could see running wood wide places open though every trees drew overshadowed dark boughs path rode still climbing gently went much

end last see open sun go past setting sun rising sun days end day begun east west woods must fail fail - even said word voice faded silence air seemed heavy making words wearisome behind large branch fell old overhanging tree crash path trees seemed close like ending failing said merry sing present wait till get edge well turn give rousing chorus spoke cheerfully felt great anxiety show others answer depressed heavy weight settling steadily frodos heart regretted every step forward ever thought challenging menace trees indeed stop propose going back still possible things took new turn path stopped climbing became nearly level dark trees drew aside ahead could see path going almost straight forward distance stood green hill-top treeless rising like bald head encircling wood path seemed making directly hurried forward delighted thought climbing roof forest path dipped began climb upwards leading last foot steep hillside left trees faded turf wood stood round hill like thick hair ended sharply circle round shaven crown hobbits led ponies winding round round reached top stood gazed air gleaming sunlit hazy could see great distance near hand mist almost gone though lay hollows

flies stopped buzzing gentle noise edge hearing soft fluttering song half whispered seemed stir boughs lifted heavy eyes saw leaning huge willow-tree old hoary enormous looked sprawling branches going like reaching arms many long-fingered hands knotted twisted trunk gaping wide fissures creaked faintly boughs moved leaves fluttering bright sky dazzled toppled lying fell upon grass merry pippin dragged forward lay backs willow-trunk behind great cracks gaped wide receive tree swayed creaked looked grey yellow leaves moving softly light singing shut eyes seemed could almost hear words cool words saying something water sleep gave spell fell fast asleep foot great grey willow frodo lay fighting sleep overpowering effort struggled feel felt compelling desire cool water wait sam stammered must bathe feet minute half dream wandered forward riverward side tree great winding roots grew stream like gnarled dragonets straining drink straddled one paddled hot feel cool brown water suddenly fell asleep back tree sam sat scratched head yawned like cavern worried afternoon getting late thought sudden sleepiness uncanny theres behind sun warm air muttered dont like great big tree dont trust hark singing sleep wont pulled feet staggered see become ponies found two wandered good way along path caught brought back towards others heard two noises one loud soft clear one splash something heavy falling water noise like snick lock door quietly closes fast rushed back bank frodo water close edge great tree-root seemed holding struggling sam gripped jacket dragged root difficulty hauled
